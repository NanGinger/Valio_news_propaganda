        "text": "\n\nValio is launching an extensive research, development and innovation project called Food 2.0. Its goal is to create a Finnish nature-smart food system in which growth, profitability and added value are built on the basis of sustainable production. The duration of the programme is five years, and it will start this year. The Food 2.0 project has been granted EUR 10 million funding in Business Finland’s challenge competition for leading companies. In addition, Business Finland is preparing to fund ecosystem projects on Food 2.0 roadmap with EUR 20 million. Business Finland is a Finnish government organization for innovation funding and trade, travel and investment promotion.\n\n\n​\n\n\nValio’s role is to initiate and lead wide-ranging cooperation as well as research and development projects with its current and new partners. Hundreds of companies and other operators are connected to the food system in Finland, and the goal is to have at least one hundred partners in the network. Valio’s and the ecosystem’s goal is to invest EUR 100 million more in research and development activities over five years and to increase exports connected to the food system by more than EUR 1 billion in the following years after the project has ended. Valio is the first food company that Business Finland has chosen as a leading company. \n\n\n“It is important that we reform the food system with all the actors involved, as that is the only way that we will succeed in the change. The global transformation of food production is also an opportunity for Finnish production, as global demand for food and the importance of northern production areas are growing. By being a forerunner in sustainable food production, we can create added value for food produced in Finland while improving its profitability and international competitiveness,” says \nTuomas Salusjärvi\n, EVP, Growth Businesses and R&D at Valio. \n\n\n“Business Finland wants to be strongly involved in the work aimed at reforming the food system. All our services contribute to strengthening the goals set by this project”, says Business Finland Director-General \nNina Kopola\n. \n\n\nThe\n global food system is changing \n\n\nThe current global food supply chain is facing challenges: the world’s population is growing, and the need for food is estimated to double by 2050. Extreme weather conditions, especially droughts, will increase with climate change in areas where majority of food is currently produced. Therefore, the importance of northern regions, such as Finland, in food production is growing. Recent global crises, such as the coronavirus pandemic and Russian aggression in Ukraine, disrupt food supply chains and threaten the security of supply. The world situation has also raised the prices of key inputs such as fertilisers and energy. This is why primary producers are struggling with unprecedented profitability challenges in Finland. \n\n\nAt the same time, the environmental impact of food production must be reduced. The entire food system – both plant and animal production – must operate more comprehensively in accordance with the principles of circular economy and resource efficiency.  \n\n\n“At the same time, we need to solve the profitability challenge of food production, meet the demands of the growing export markets and move towards more sustainable production methods. A new, more sustainable food system will build growth for food exports and also create new export opportunities, for example, in circular economy and digitalisation solutions. Rethinking the food system is also essential for the environment and food security,” says Salusjärvi. \n\n\nIn a sustainable food system, nutrients, energy and side streams circulate. The aim is to save natural resources, i.e. to use all resources efficiently and sustainably as well as to keep them in circulation for as long as possible without generating waste. Valio already works hard to achieve this in its own operations, but in the future, we will also need more cooperation between different industries, production methods and companies so that a genuine circular economy can be realised in food production. \n\n\nFurther information: \n\n\nHow can I get involved? \n\n\nValio will start building the ecosystem of companies in the food system immediately. The process will begin by launching already identified research and development projects. Later on, Valio will actively strive to create new development paths with partners related to the ecosystem. \n\n\nThe various research projects and other outputs of the Food 2.0 project focus on four themes: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture products \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology transformation \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegenerative production \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircular economy and resource efficiency \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can participate in the food system reform, for example, in projects initiated by the ecosystem. You can join by contacting Research Manager Riitta Partanen (\nriitta.partanen@valio.fi\n). \n\n\nFind out more about the food system of the future on \nValio’s info page\n (English summary and downloadable information material at the bottom of the page).

        "text": "\n\nOn 30 January 2024, Valio will start change negotiations that affect Valio’s Finnish headquarters functions, technical services, maintenance and factory services. A total of 1,170 people are within the scope of the negotiations.\n\n\nThe change negotiations will deal with potential dismissals of employment and material changes to the terms and conditions of employment, such as changes in job descriptions or in the content of the job duties. Potential headcount reductions will affect up to 130 people, and the planned material changes to the terms and conditions of employment will affect up to 135 people. Valio employs about 4,300 people, 3,700 of them work in Finland.\n\n\nThe grounds for the negotiations are production and economic reasons and the resulting operational restructuring. \n\n\nThe general global economic situation is currently weak and this is also reflected in Valio’s business operations.\n\n\n“The operating environment has been very challenging for us for a long time. There are several factors behind the change negotiations: the increase in Valio’s own operating expenses, weakening demand for consumer products and fall in global prices of industrial products. All of these factors have challenged our profitability. Unfortunately, for these reasons, we are forced to initiate change negotiations,” says \nMarianne Tammela\n, Executive Vice President, People, Strategy and Innovations function.\n\n\nValio is owned by about 3,400 dairy farms through cooperatives, and Valio pays its operating profits to the farmers. \n\n\n“Through profitable business operations, we ensure the vitality of our owners, i.e. the dairy farms, and we secure the continuity of Finnish food production. That enable us in the long run to also create jobs and livelihoods around Finland,” notes Tammela. \n\n\nThe change negotiations are expected to take six weeks.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nThe use of electric boilers in industrial energy production has grown in popularity along with companies' climate programs, energy efficiency goals and fluctuating electricity markets. This opportunity was also seized at Valio's Haapavesi factory. With the new long-term agreement, energy company Adven implements and will in the future be responsible for the annual energy production of more than 50 GWh for the needs of the Haapavesi factory with a modern electric boiler solution.\n\n\nHaapavesi factory in Central Finland is the home of Valio Oltermanni® cheeses. At Haapavesi c. 200 million liters of raw milk a year is processed into award winning cheeses and milk powder for domestic use and export needs. \n\n\nValio’s goal is to reset milk’s carbon footprint to net zero by 2035. In terms of energy production, this means improving energy efficiency, phasing out fossil fuels and utilizing energy produced by heat pumps and electric boilers. \n\n\n– Securing the availability of thermal energy was a key criterion when we started thinking about the future of Haapavesi factory’s energy implementation, says Energy Manager \nPeter Fabritius\n from Valio. \n\n\n– The current backup energy plant utilizing light fuel oil will continue alongside the future electric boiler plant, enabling flexible energy production between two different options when the availability and the price of electricity fluctuates. This way the boiler also contributes to maintaining the stability of the electricity network. Adven offered a modern solution in which precise optimization ensures the availability of energy in every situation.\n\n\nProcess steam production will be electrified in 2026\n\n\nAdven offered Valio a modern electric steam boiler solution and energy production to replace the current biomass and peat-based production.  The new technical implementation covers a 12 MW electric steam boiler with connections. This is Adven’s second electric boiler implementation for Valio.\n\n\n– The challenges of industrial energy production are being solved fiercely nowadays. Pursuit for zero emissions, increasing the efficiency of energy production and as in Valio’s case, securing energy availability are key decision-making criteria, says Sales Manager \nArto Liikanen\n from Adven.\n\n\n– For them we proposed a completely new solution instead of a traditional biomass steam plant. Shared ambition was soon found. \n\n\nToday, the heat used at Valio’s Haapavesi plant is mostly produced in a solid fuel-based energy plant. \n\n\nIn the future, heat will mainly be produced by an electric boiler, which does not emit carbon dioxide.\n\n\nAdven to be responsible for the total energy production in Haapavesi\n\n\nValio and Adven are long-term partners, and Adven produces energy as a service for eight of Valio’s factories in Finland. At Haapavesi too, versatile cooperation has lasted for more 30 years, and most recently Adven has been responsible for the factory’s backup energy production.\n\n\nWith the new contract, Adven will in the future be responsible for the factory’s total energy production with the energy-as-a-service model, which covers the design of the new electric boiler plant and network, project management and financing, and once completed, also plant operation and energy production.\n\n\nBackup energy production also remains Adven’s responsibility.\n\n\nThe project started in December 2023 and the commissioning is planned to start in March 2026. \n\n\nKey facts\n\n\n\n\nA high voltage 12MW electric steam boiler plant which annually produces 50 GWh of energy for the production needs of Valio’s Haapavesi factory. \n\n\nEnergy produced with an electric boiler does not emit carbon dioxide.\n\n\nA new electric boiler energy site will be commissioned in March 2026. \n\n\nValio Haapavesi factory processes 200 million liters of raw milk delivered from c. 500 dairy farms. \n\n\nProcess steam is used in various heating phases along the production, drying of milk and whey powder and in cheese production in cheese kettles. \n\n\nHaapavesi factory produces 29 million kilos of cheese and milk powder, and the factory directly employs c. 125 and indirectly thousands of employees. \n\n\nThe project has been granted NextGeneration EU funding from the European Union.\n\n\n\n"

The more than €10 million investment will enhance the preprocessing of the frozen berries, fruit, vegetables and herbs processed in the plant and increase predictability in production and raw materials management. The new automated preprocessing facility will become operational in 2025. \n\n\nConstruction of the new preprocessing facility at Valio’s Suonenjoki plant has begun in December 2023. The upgrade will add several hundred square meters to the preprocessing area, and a new melting system for frozen products will be introduced to improve and facilitate the handling of frozen raw materials at the beginning of production. The construction work will not affect the plant’s operations. \n\n\n“The investment will also bring new technology to the plant, enabling it to raise the temperature of frozen raw materials from the -20°C during transport and storage to the product processing temperature of -2°C in a matter of a few minutes. Additionally, new automation will facilitate the handling of heavy, frozen raw materials. This will significantly increase the efficiency and speed of the plant’s production and bring flexibility to the manufacturing of products,” notes Suonenjoki Plant Manager \nMarkku Ihasalo\n. \n\n\nThe robotics technology to be built in the new pretreatment facility will help to considerably reduce physically taxing work. This will have a positive impact on the wellbeing and work resilience of Valio employees. \n\n\n“The growing pretreatment and production area and the upgraded process technology will allow us to develop and expand our plant’s operations. This is an important investment in the future of the Suonenjoki plant and also a vote of confidence in our work,” Ihasalo continues.  \n\n\nAround 500 different raw materials pass through the Suonenjoki plant each year \n \n\n\nValio’s Suonenjoki plant is Finland’s largest jam plant; it produces a wide range of jams, marmalades, cream fillings, purees and flavoured oils for both Valio and other food companies such as bakeries. In all, the plant processes some 500 different raw materials, from exotic fruits to Finnish berries. \n\n\nThe berries arriving at the Suonenjoki plant are frozen and the fruit is usually prechopped or otherwise preprocessed. After raw materials been melted, the raw materials are thawed and then preprocessed, i.e. pureed, sieved or chopped. Depending on the product, flavourings or gelling agents, for example, may be added to the berry and fruit raw materials. \n\n\n“For example, we make vanilla creams for bakeries, Valio AURA® cheese filling for ready-made meatballs and butterscotch filling for doughnuts. We also make the berry, fruit, vegetable and herb preparations used to flavour all Valio’s yoghurts, fresh cheeses and quarks,” notes Ihasalo.  \n\n\nThe Suonenjoki plant employs around 100 people in product production processes, in raw materials receiving and handling, and in product development. The product development side of the plant produces dozens of new and seasonal products every year. Customised development work is also done for bakeries and other customers. Around 85% of the Suonenjoki plant’s production is used for Valio’s yoghurts, flavoured quarks and other snacks. Most products go to Valio’s plants in Riihimäki, Oulu and Seinäjoki. Purees are delivered to Valio’s Pitäjänmäki juice plant. The rest is sold to food industry companies in Finland and abroad via Valio’s B2B and Food Service sales.  \n\n"

        "text": "\n\nJamk University of Applied Sciences organized hackathon for Valio Ltd. to find solutions to equalize seasonal variation in milk production. Swedish Elvenite AB offered the winning solution for ValioHackathon. The winner aims to utilize data straight from primary production.\n\n\nSeasonal variation refers to the monthly variation in milk volume. Dairy farms aim to achieve the most consistent milk production volume throughout the year.\n\n\n“Valio’s customers buy milk products evenly throughout the year. However, the amount of milk entering Valio’s production varies throughout the year. During the summer months, milk production is high, while in the winter months it is lower. This results in inefficiencies for both dairy farms and Valio’s factories”, says \nUlf Jahnsson\n, VP of Primary Production at Valio.\n\n\nSwedish Elvenite AB offered the winning solution for ValioHackathon 2023/11/28. Elvenite proposed to pilot a data model for understanding the factors affecting the seasonality of the milk production. Pilot would be developed based on a dataset collected from representative sample of dairy farms featuring farms with high and low seasonality.\n\n\n“We have already started the discussion with Elvenite on the next steps,” Ulf Jahnsson says.  \n\n\n“Elvenite provided us a comprehensive approach to tackling seasonality in milk production. It came apparent that we do not have a thorough understanding of the factors affecting seasonality and why some farms have a steeper seasonality than others. With the comprehensive data analysis and comparison of farms with low and high seasonality, we can get to the bottom of the challenge and understand also what solutions would be the most effective. Then, we can prioritize the action plans for farms and have a smart and effective response to the challenge,” says \nHanna Castro\n, Development Manager at Valio. \n\n\nEqualizing this seasonal variation in milk production would make Valio’s production planning more efficient. Constant production levels would enable leaner and more efficient operations in the entire production chain. This would improve cost control and contribute also to Valio’s carbon neutral milk by 2035 aim.\n\n\n“ValioHackathon was a great experience for us. Especially meeting all the mentors that had very different points of input and different backgrounds has been very valuable. Interacting with all the participants and people with in-depth knowledge on the dairy farm operations was inspirational and gave a lot of insights to the challenge at hand,” tell \nAgnes Lindell\n and \nNiclas Lovsjö\n, Elvenite. \n\n\nThe hackathon was organized for Valio by the BioBoosters by Jamk Bio and circular economy business accelerator, together with Estonian University of Life Sciences and Kasvu Open.\n\n\nThe open call for solution providers attracted a record number of 18 applications from the Baltic Sea Region. Six teams from three countries were selected to attend the final stage of the innovation competition. The six teams selected for the Hackathon were Anicare Oy, Elvenite AB, Quanturi Oy, Condensed milk, SimHerd A/S, and HAMK Smart Data and Business Analytics team. \n\n\n”We were happy to see a wide range of applications and a high-level of interest to ValioHackathon. The applications gave a good overview of the approaches available for tackling the challenge of seasonal variation in milk production. In the team selection, we prioritized new, innovative data-based applications to manage the dairy farm operations and gain more balanced production”, stated \nSanna Nokka\n, Development Manager at Valio. \n\n\n“Valio has encouraged all participating teams to continue working on their idea and the dialogue with Valio. Hopefully, once we have the collaboration with Elvenite, and a better understanding of the factors affecting seasonal variation, we can prioritise the steps and solutions needed. At this stage, the solutions presented by teams will come in hand,” Hanna Castro says.\n\n\nValioHackathon is part of the international BioBoosters project, led by Jamk University of Applied Sciences and co-funded by the Interreg Baltic Sea Region Programme. The project brings together nine innovation networks in the bioeconomy sector from countries around the Baltic Sea: Finland, Sweden, the Baltic States, Poland, and Germany. The project organizes 18 Hackathons to support responsible business practices and the transition to a circular economy for bioeconomy companies.\n\n\nAdditional information about ValioHackathon:\n\n\nhttps://www.jamk.fi/fi/projekti/biopaavo/biopaavo-hackathon/valiohackathon\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nPress release 23.11.2023 Leading Finnish dairy company Valio has launched a new milk protein concentrate (MPC), Valio Eila® MPC 65. Valio’s expertise in lactose free milk protein development helps manufacturers create better-tasting and healthier high-protein products to meet the growing global market needs.\n\n\nValio has reimagined the future of protein with the launch of Valio Eila® MPC 65. The new concentrate continues in the footsteps of Valio’s other protein-enriching products, bringing the taste and texture of the end product to the forefront. Lactose free for better digestive comfort, this new product can elevate protein puddings, shakes, ice creams, and drinks to the next level.\n\n\nTasty and healthy without compromise – no sandy texture or undesirable flavour\n\n\nIn the highly competitive field of protein-enriched foods, a common issue is that the flavour and the texture of the end products can be a little bit off. This was the issue Valio sought to fix with the development of Valio Eila® MPC 65.\n\n\n“Consumers leading an active lifestyle want excellent nutritional value without compromising on the taste. We needed a product that has all the benefits of milk’s natural whey and casein proteins and amino acids, and none of the taste and texture problems usually associated with high-protein powders”, says \nSinikka Saikkonen\n, Business Development Manager at Valio.\n\n\nThe result is a new product that the manufacturers will love – Valio Eila® MPC 65. It combines Valio’s expertise in lactose free with the nutritional values of excellent dairy milk protein.\n\n\n“Valio Eila® MPC 65 can be used to create a versatile selection of lactose free, high-protein products that will taste like they were made from fresh milk and have the texture of traditional snacks and treats. It truly is a game changer in the field of protein-enriched products”, adds \nJarna Tanskanen\n, Business Manager at Valio.\n\n\nConsumers loved new, tasty high-protein products\n\n\nAs always, to ensure that the flavour and texture of the end product are what the consumers want, Valio conducted a consumer test in Germany. A group of 110 people participated in the test.\n\n\nWhen tested against four leading competitors, Valio’s high protein UHT ready-to-drink (RTD) prototype was best liked overall. Consumers who liked the thicker texture of the drink gave its appearance, flavour (taste), and texture/mouthfeel a high score. Nearly 70% of consumers agreed that Valio’s RTD prototype had ideal flavour and sweetness, being the highest score in the test.\n\n\n“We offered samples of the RTD prototype at Growth Asia Summit and Vitafoods Asia in September, and people were visibly amazed by the flavour and texture. They couldn’t believe it’s a protein-enriched drink and not a regular chocolate shake”, says \nMeri Härmälä\n, International B2B Marketing Manager at Valio.\n\n\nThe consumer test showed that flavour is the most important purchase criterion. Other important factors were a short ingredient list, a high level of protein and the fact that there is no added sugar. Consumers are also looking for good value for money, a good source of protein and natural ingredients. Valio Eila® MPC 65 makes it easy to create a protein-enriched product that matches those demands.\n\n\nMilk protein concentrate helps manufacturers streamline their production\n\n\nValio’s new protein product portfolio is designed specifically for manufacturers that are looking for ways to meet the growing consumer demand for high protein, lactose free and great-tasting snacking products.\n\n\n“When you use Valio Eila® MPC 65 to create a new product, you don’t need to add anything extra to hide its flavour. This also helps keep the ingredient list short, which is exactly what consumers are looking for”, Tanskanen explains.\n\n\nWith the addition of Valio Eila® MPC 65 to the product portfolio, Valio can serve its customers even better than before, with a steady supply of high-quality powdered milk ingredients. By replacing liquid milk with powdered milk products, a manufacturer can easily streamline their production process without additional steps, such as filtration, concentration or hydrolysation that are usually related to higher protein and lower lactose contents.\n\n\n“Valio’s powdered ingredients are suitable for versatile processes. You can make UHT products such as RTD beverages and shakes, fermented products such as spoonable and drinkable yogurts, neutral products like puddings and desserts, or even ice cream. And they will all taste great and have a pleasant texture”, Saikkonen adds.\n\n\nFor more information on Valio Eila® MPC 65 and ingredients, please visit the Valio website or contact a Valio representative.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nThe Valio and St1 joint venture Suomen Lantakaasu Oy is exploring the implementation of new biogas plant complexes in several areas. The construction of possible new plant complexes is now being explored in the Kokkola-Pietarsaari, Nivala-Haapavesi and South Ostrobothnia regions. Along with the existing planned plant complexes, Suomen Lantakaasu Oy is progressing towards its production target of one terawatt-hour by 2030.\n\n\nSuomen Lantakaasu Oy’s investment in the industrial-scale, centralised biogas plant in Kiuruvesi and its satellite plants in Upper Savo and North Karelia is progressing on schedule. In August, Suomen Lantakaasu and the city of Kiuruvesi agreed on the future site acquisition process and on the siting of the biogas plant complex. In October, Suomen Lantakaasu announced that it is planning complex-related satellite facilities in Varpaisjärvi, Nurmes and Sonkajärvi. \n\n\n“Thanks to the good progress in the planning and zoning process for the Upper Savo plant, we can start planning the next biogas plant complexes. We are currently looking into biogas plant complexes in the Kokkola-Pietarsaari and Nivala-Haapavesi regions and we are also exploring opportunities in the South Ostrobothnia region. The aim is to have the biogas plants planned for Kiuruvesi and North, Central and South Ostrobothnia up and running by 2030. Among other things, the availability of sites zoned for the plants would give momentum to the biogas plant investments,” notes \nMatti Oksanen\n, Director, Gas Business at St1.\n\n\nThe preparation of Suomen Lantakaasu Oy’s first plant complex is currently moving forward in Upper Savo and North Karelia. The site in Kiuruvesi has already been selected, and the site selections for the satellite plants were confirmed in October. The progression of the preparatory work will also speed up the planning of the new plant complexes. \n\n\n“We have been very pleased with the cooperation with the Upper Savo municipalities during the preparation of the biogas plant complex. Good experiences encourage rapid progression also with the new areas and new plant complexes. Good cooperation with regional municipalities or authorities has been very important for Suomen Lantakaasu’s investment in the Upper Savo area,” says \nJanika Keinänen\n, Valio’s Project Manager in charge of biogas business development.\n\n\nThe biogas plant complexes will produce biogas and hygienised biofertilisers from the manure and other agricultural by-products of local farms. Suomen Lantakaasu Oy will collect manure from farms and will provide the farms with the biofertiliser generated in the production of the biogas. The fertiliser treated in the plant is less odorous, more efficient and more environmentally friendly than untreated manure. With the new biofertiliser, farm nitrogen fertiliser costs will decrease because the amount of soluble nitrogen in biofertiliser is as much as 20-30% higher than in manure.\n\n\nClean transition investments bring prosperity and growth throughout Finland\n\n\nThe clean transition can bring significant vitality-enhancing investments and capital to regions. The Ostrobothnia region as a whole is rich in manure and agricultural waste, which makes biogas plant investments a viable option specifically for this region. However, the implementation of biogas projects also requires the government to take an active role, for example in upgrading roads and other infrastructure. In addition, investments in the green transition require a stable business environment and support mechanisms to encourage investment in renewable energy production. The government has an important role in creating incentives to increase the use of renewable fuels and energy sources. Investing in renewable fuels and increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix will accelerate a carbon-neutral society. Policy measures to support low-carbon and zero-emission energy systems are a prerequisite for a successful green transition.\n\n\n“The planning of the industrial-scale biogas production as envisaged by Suomen Lantakaasu Oy, including the permitting and construction phases, will take about half a decade. Taking on such projects requires the regulatory framework to be predictable and stable and the support environment to be effective and efficient from an investment perspective. The investments will create economic activity in Finland for decades to come, so it must be made sure that companies have no uncertainty about the political climate,” concludes Janika Keinänen.\n\n\nSuomen Lantakaasu Oy\n\n\n\n\nFood company Valio and energy company St1 have established a joint venture to produce renewable biogas from dairy farm manure and agricultural by-products to fuel transport.\n\n\nIn Finland, of the around 15-17 million tonnes of livestock manure produced annually, some 7-8 million tonnes are produced on farms belonging to cooperatives that own Valio.\n\n\nFinland has enough manure to produce about 3-5 TWh of biomethane, which could fuel 400,000 passenger cars or almost 30,000 light trucks per year.\n\n\nIn addition to biomethane, bioplants can produce recycled fertilisers, bedding or growing media. The recycling of manure reduces the carbon footprint of dairy farms by up to 10%. Higher quality fertiliser reduces the farm’s need for imported fertilisers by 20-30% and thus improves farm profitability. \n\n\nDomestically produced renewable fuel contributes significantly to the national roadmap for fossil-free transport and improves Finland’s fuel self-sufficiency.\n\n\nSuomen Lantakaasu Oy’s first project in Ylä-Savo is funded by the European Union NextGenerationEU.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nThrough a voluntary Green Deal agreement, Valio is committing to reduce the amount of plastic used in its single-use, single-serving packaging by 15% by the end of 2026 compared to 2022. Valio will now package all Valio PROfeel® quark products in recyclable paperboard cups. The change will result in 143 tonnes less plastic being used, equivalent to 6,800,000 plastic shopping bags. With this commitment, Valio is contributing to the national target for an ambitious reduction in single-use, single-serving plastic packaging.\n\n\nThe Single-Use Plastics Directive, which came into force in 2019, aims to reduce the amount of plastic waste in the environment, particularly seashores, and to promote the circular economy. Valio has significantly reduced the amount of plastic in its packaging for many years, for example by eliminating detachable lids/caps, plastic spoons and straws from single-serving packages. In addition, Valio has reduced the amount of plastic by using thinner plastic in its packaging, for example, in its sliced cheese packaging, and by packaging yoghurts and quarks in paperboard-wrapped cups.\n\n\nWith the voluntary Green Deal agreement, Valio commits to further reduce the use of plastic in its single-serving packaging. This change is now reflected in the increasing use of paperboard cups in Valio’s snack products. \n\n\n“Paperboard cups have been used in single-serving yoghurts, for example, already since 2021. Going forward, all Valio PROfeel® quark products will be packaged in recyclable paperboard cups. Valio’s goal is that by the end of 2025 all packaging will be suitable for a true circular economy, meaning that new products can be made from it. We are continuously developing our packaging so that it better aligns with the circular economy and to reduce its climate impact. We have added plain-language recycling instructions to our packaging to make recycling as easy as possible for everyone,” notes Valio’s Head of Packaging Development \nJuhana Pilkama\n.\n\n\nVoluntary Green Deal agreement seeks sustainable solutions\n\n\nThe Green Deal agreement seeks solutions to climate challenges, biodiversity loss, overconsumption of natural resources and the promotion of the circular economy in Finland. The Green Deal agreement is made between the government and business as well as public sector actors. The aim of the agreement is to jointly promote sustainable development goals on a voluntary basis without additional legislation.\n\n\n“Green Deal agreements can strengthen or complement legislation. They can also impose stricter targets than legislation and achieve certain objectives without additional national regulation. Voluntary agreements give us more flexibility than legislation to find the most effective, efficient, timely solutions to achieve our common goals,” notes Juhana Pilkama.\n\n\nValio’s plastic reduction and circular economy actions:\n\n\n\n\nGourmet cheese packaging made from 90% recycled plastic starting in 2018.\n\n\nThinner packaging for sliced cheese products in 2020; more than 55% of the packaging material comes from plastic bottles recycled in Finland. \n\n\nDiscontinued detachable plastic lids/caps, spoons and straws in 2020. \n\n\nTransition from plastic cups to paperboard cups in some product packaging starting in 2021. \n\n\nUse of recycled plastic in packaging of drinkable snacks starting in 2023.\n\n\nFirst SUP directive-compliant tethered caps for beverage containers under three litres in early 2023, and all packaging changes completed by summer 2024.\n\n\n\n\nThe Green Deal agreements and the commitments made to them are part of Society’s Commitment to Sustainable Development introduced by the Finnish National Commission on Sustainable Development. Businesses and public actors commit to promote the goals and actions of the agreements by making a ministry-approved commitment on the \nSitoumus 2050 website\n.\n\n"

This is a natural step on the growth journey that began in 2018 and recently landed a record turnover of 23.5 million euros in 2022.\n\n\n“Planti is our first acquisition and the next step on our growth journey. In the first half of this year, we delivered great momentum with +40% organic growth, compared to 2022, and growing significantly faster than the market. Planti's portfolio complements our existing offering and strengthens our market position especially in spoonables and cooking. This fits right into our strategy in which we, with the support of our owners Valio and Mandatum Asset Management, are actively pursuing opportunities to grow through acquisitions like this one,” says \nNiko Vuorenmaa\n, CEO, Oddlygood. \n\n\nValio acquires Planti’s production \n\n\nThe transaction, closed on 30.9., is twofold. Through the acquisition, Oddlygood becomes the owner of the Planti products and brand, as well as related intellectual property rights. Oddlygood becomes the market leader in dairy alternative spoonable snacks in Sweden\n1\n, and in dairy alternative cooking products in Finland\n2\n. The acquisition makes Oddlygood the second largest in the plant-based dairy alternatives market in Sweden\n3\n and the third largest in Finland\n4\n. \n\n\nSimultaneously, Oddlygood's majority owner Valio acquires Planti's production in Turku, including employees at the site.\n\n\nOddlygood has grown successfully even though the market is temporarily slowing and many other players are struggling. Long term, the global plant-based dairy alternatives market is expected to grow by double digits, from 2021-2030, to $69 billion at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.0%\n5\n. The market is driven by consumer interest in different aspects of sustainability along with a demand for tasty and healthy products, variety and the fact that food is becoming even more of a lifestyle marker.  \n\n\n“We see great long-term growth potential in the market for plant-based products and they have a key role in Valio’s growth strategy. As a result of the acquisition, we at Valio continue to strengthen our position as a world-class developer and manufacturer of plant-based products that fulfil the taste, nutrition and texture expectations of current and next product generations,” says \nKimmo Luoma\n, Senior Vice President, Valio Food. \n\n\nUntil today, the Planti brand was part of the Norwegian Kavli Group. Its turnover in 2022 was 10.9 million euros.\n\n\n“\nTo sell Planti is a strategic decision we have considered thoroughly, aiming to focus on other categories in our business. We have been waiting for the right match and buyer profile who has the capacity and ambition to develop Planti. We are happy that Oddlygood and Valio are coming aboard and wish the new owners the best of luck\n,”\n says \nKenneth Hamnes\n, Group CEO of KavliHolding AS.\n\n\nThe companies are not disclosing the amount of the deal. The transaction does not result in any immediate changes in the Oddlygood® or Planti® product range or in their production.\n\n \n\n\n1 \nRef.no. 04983299, Date: 2023-09-29 Source: Nielsen ScanTrack, DVH Totalt, Yoghurt Alternative, Sales Value, MAT TY, 2023 W.36 (Copyright © NielsenIQ.)\n\n\n2 \nNielsenIQ Homescan Finland.\n \nNon-dairy cooking.

        "text": "\n\nLeading Finnish dairy company Valio collaborated with top nutritional scientists in a new study about the effects of MFGM and milk protein on the physical functioning of the elderly. The results show significant improvement in balance and physical performance even without an exercise intervention\n\n\nThis study is among the first conducted in Europe on the benefits of partially hydrolysed, high-protein milk products rich in MFGM when introduced to a regular everyday diet instead of through dietary supplements.\n\n\nSeparating the benefits of nutrition and exercise\n\n\n“We wanted to separate the effects of nutrition, specifically MFGM, from exercise, which has been a component in most, if not all of the previous studies conducted in this particular field,” says \nAnu Turpeinen\n, PhD, Nutrition Research Manager at Valio.\n\n\nThe study followed 101 Finnish women, aged 70 or over, for 12 weeks. The group was divided into an intervention group (n=51) and a control group (n=50). The studied women were all able to move independently but showed some signs of sarcopenia or slight deficits in physical functioning in the baseline tests.\n\n\nThe intervention group was given a powder or a ready-to-drink product that contained 23 g hydrolysed protein and 3 g MFGM, for daily consumption. The products were made using Valio buttermilk concentrate. To rule out the effect of exercise, both groups were given the same minimal exercise guidance.\n\n\nPhysical functioning was then tested for both groups by measuring hand grip strength and SPPB (short physical performance battery), which includes testing balance, walking speed, and the ability to rise from a chair unaided. Both groups were tested twice, at baseline and the end of the study.\n\n\nResults indicate that combining MFGM and milk protein may improve physical performance\n\n\nThe results showed significant improvements in physical functioning among the participants, especially in the balance and the SPPB total scores.\n\n\n\n\nAnother notable difference was that the protein intake increased significantly in the intervention group from 0,9 to 1,1 g/kg body weight. There were no significant changes in the energy intake or the participants’ weight during the study.\n\n\nThe participants thought that the ready-to-drink protein shake was delicious and easy to use and that it may have helped them feel less hungry and have fewer sweet cravings. \n\n\n“Next, we are planning a second study that focuses on the possible cognitive benefits on elderly individuals with issues in cognitive functioning,” Turpeinen concludes.\n\n\nWhy hydrolysed protein?\n\n\n\n\nAbsorbed more efficiently than intact protein in elderly\n\n\nCauses fewer gastrointestinal problems in sensitive individuals\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM)?\n\n\n\n\nA unique component of cow’s milk fat, not found in vegetable oils\n\n\nContains complex lipids, such as phospholipids, necessary for the brain and nervous system and stimulate neuromuscular function\n\n\nShown to have benefits on physical function in earlier studies with seniors\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on the NutriSen study, please visit the \nValio website\n.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nConstruction preparations are progressing for the biogas production plant of Suomen Lantakaasu Oy, a joint venture of food company Valio and energy company St1. Suomen Lantakaasu Oy and the city of Kiuruvesi, Finland, have agreed on the zoning of the future site and the location of the biogas production plant complex. The choice of the site was influenced by consultations with residents during the selection process. \n\n\nThe biogas plant will produce renewable liquefied biogas from the manure and other agricultural by-products of cattle farms in Upper Savo. At the same time, hygienised biofertiliser will be produced for use by local farmers. It is more efficient and environmentally friendly than untreated manure and less odorous than untreated liquid manure. \n\n\nThe site selected for the plant is located on the south side of Pyhäsalmentie road, four kilometres from the centre of Kiuruvesi. The choice of this site was guided by the conclusions of the North Savo ELY Centre’s environmental impact assessment, which was completed in July, and by consultations with residents during the assessment. The site is defined as an industrial area in the regional plan. The site is flanked by the municipality’s old landfill areas, which are currently used as a landfill site and logging storage site. \n\n\n“After careful research, a logistical assessment and discussions with the residents of Kiuruvesi, we have concluded that, of the alternatives presented to us, this is the choice that best serves the area’s vitality, the liveability for the residents and traffic safety. Cooperation with the city of Kiuruvesi and the local residents has been constructive throughout the site selection process. We want to continue an open dialogue with the people of Kiuruvesi to develop an approach that serves the whole area,” says \nJanika Keinänen\n, Valio’s Project Manager in charge of biogas business development.  \n\n\n“After completion of the site selection and the environmental impact assessment, the preparation process for the biogas plant will advance to the permitting phase. We are committed to continuing to work closely with the city of Kiuruvesi and local residents at all stages of the plant construction process. In early autumn, we will organise discussion and information sessions for farmers, residents and other interested parties in the area,” adds \nMatti Oksanen\n, Director, Gas Business at St1.  \n\n\nBiogas plant will bring vitality to the entire Upper Savo region \n\n\n“In Kiuruvesi, we are very pleased that the biogas plant project in our city is progressing swiftly and in good cooperation. The realisation of the biogas plant complex will bring significant investments, tax revenue and new economic momentum, and it will significantly support the most important industry in Kiuruvesi and all of Upper Savo. The plant will bring a wide range of jobs and economic activity to our region, both during the construction phase and when the plant is commissioned,” notes \nJuha-Pekka Rusanen\n, Mayor of Kiuruvesi.  \n\n\nThe plant investment is also seen as an opportunity to develop the road network in the region. Discussions on Pyhäsalmentie road’s light traffic routes and improving intersections in the area have already started with the ELY Centre responsible for the road and the Regional Council of North Savo. The city has also started preparing the zoning changes for the selected site. \n\n\n“I believe that the site choice is the best possible for Kiuruvesi residents’ traffic safety and the plant’s feeder traffic. This view was also emphasised in the feedback from residents,” Rusanen continues.  \n\n\nBenefits for farms and the climate\n  \n\n\nThe Suomen Lantakaasu Oy plant being designed for Upper Savo is a so-called hybrid plant. This means that there is one industrial-scale, centralised liquefied biogas production plant in Kiuruvesi and smaller satellite biogas plants in clusters of several farms elsewhere in the Upper Savo region. \n\n\nThis will keep the biogas feedstock transport distances as short as possible. Suomen Lantakaasu Oy will collect manure from farms and will provide the farms with the bio-fertiliser generated in the production of the biogas. The farm’s nitrogen fertiliser cost will decrease because the amount of soluble nitrogen in biofertiliser is as much as 20-30% higher than in manure. The plant is scheduled for completion in 2026. \n\n\nThere is a growing interest in biogas production among Valio dairy farms in the region because it has a positive impact on farm profitability and improves nutrient cycling on the farm. The use of manure for biogas production reduces the carbon footprint of milk production by up to 25% when taking into account emission reductions from both agriculture and transport. Valio’s target is to cut milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035 and to keep the domestic dairy industry vibrant across Finland.  \n\n\nSt1 has solid expertise in both biogas production and distribution  \n\n\nSt1 is already Sweden’s leading biogas player in the road transport segment. Its biogas operations are located in the urban areas of southern Sweden and in Stockholm. The company produces, imports and exports biogas and supplies it to customers through several sales channels. St1 also has six biogas production and upgrading units in Sweden. St1 is currently building a biogas upgrading and liquefaction facility in Borås, Sweden. The biorefinery is expected to be operational at the end of 2024. \n\n\nIn Finland, St1 is currently building biogas refuelling stations for heavy transport. The first LBG filling stations will open at the turn of the year in Mäntsälä and Iittala, in Hämeenlinna. In Norway, Biogass Energi AS, 33.33% owned by St1, is building six biogas filling stations across the country; the filling stations will be operational by the end of 2024. St1 aims to have a comprehensive biogas refuelling network in the Nordic countries and to increase production. \n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio’s sustainability bonus programme for dairy farms was updated on 1.5.2023. Previously, farms that have taken actions to improve animal welfare have received additional pay for the milk they supply. Going forward, farms can receive an additional cent per milk litre for farming practices supporting biodiversity, for grazing their cattle and providing access to outdoor activity, and for efforts aiming to reduce the farm’s carbon footprint. With the update, Valio will pay its dairy farmer owners, through cooperatives, nearly 50 million euros annually for sustainability actions.\n\n\nPreviously, the sustainability bonus was two cents per milk litre; now farms can earn an additional cent by combining various actions. For example, the average sized farm of 45 cows currently receives a sustainability bonus of 8,000 euros. With the programme update, it’s possible to increase the bonus to 12,000 euros. About 80% of the milk produced in Finland is within the sphere of Valio’s sustainability bonus programme.\n\n\n“Since 2021, all Valio farms have been within the sphere of the sustainability bonus programme by committing to the actions required to improve animal welfare. Now it is time to raise the bar to also boost climate actions, biodiversity and the grazing of cows. The new actions included in the sustainability bonus programme are voluntary for the farms, and each farm can choose the programme actions that are the right fit for their farm to reduce the climate impacts of milk production and to increase biodiversity. Animal welfare continues to be an important theme, and now we will focus particularly on increasing the grazing of cows and their year-round access to outdoor activity,” says \nIlkka Pohjamo\n, Senior Vice President, Primary Production at Valio.\n\n\nStarting 1.5.2023, dairy farms can receive an additional cent per milk litre they produce by, e.g., ensuring  grazing and year-round outdoor access, by planting biodiversity zones that benefit pollinators, by practicing carbon farming methods, by cultivating multi-species grasses and by using the Carbo® Farm calculator to report the carbon footprint of the milk they produce. \n\n\n“More than 2,200 farms are already using the Valio Carbo® carbon footprint calculator and about 1,500 farms, i.e. 25 per cent of all Valio dairy farms, have taken part in carbon farming training. Carbon farming methods are already being used on nearly 85,000 hectares,” says Ilkka Pohjamo.\n\n\nNo food production without biodiversity\n\n\nMilk production impacts biodiversity in both negative and positive ways. For example, clearing fields in areas of high natural value and cultivating peatlands reduce biodiversity. Grazing cows, on the other hand, enhances biodiversity because cattle manure attracts insects, which in turn attract birds. The positive biodiversity impacts of grasslands for grazing can be enhanced by maximising the rotation period of grasses and by using multi-species grasses. Grazing can be used to control invasive alien species that adversely impact the diversity of native species.\n\n\nFor example, nearly a quarter of all the species classified as threatened in Finland live in highly endangered traditional biotopes. Therefore, the preservation of traditional biotopes through grazing is particularly important. Regenerative farming methods and perennial, multi-species grassland cultivation also enhance biodiversity, improve soil condition and increase carbon sequestration, thus benefiting both the environment and the farmer. \n\n\n“Valio has developed a multi-species grass seed mixture that improves carbon sequestration and biodiversity, as well as a seed mixture that attracts pollinators and can be used to grow biodiversity strips along the borders of fields, for instance,” says Ilkka Pohjamo.\n\n\nThe heifers on the Pietinmäki farm in Mynämäki have been grazing for 50 years in a traditional biotope area along the coast of Mynälahti bay. The area contains traditional biotopes of various ages, the oldest and most valuable of which is an open seashore meadow. The Pietinmäki farm’s \nKatja \nand\n Henri Hartikainen\n know that without biodiversity, farming would also cease. By diversifying cultivation and crops, they are more likely to have good yields even in exceptional years. \n\n\n“It was easy to choose the right actions for our farm from the new voluntary sustainability bonus actions. It’s nice that we’ll be paid for the sustainability actions in the milk price,” they say.\n\n\n“Last year we planted a landscape field from which people passing by could pick flowers. There were plenty of varieties of winged insects seen in the field. The grass is a mixture of 6-7 species, with peas, broad beans, maize and sorghum,” the Hartikainens note.\n\n\nValio is owned by ca. 3,700 Finnish dairy farms through cooperatives, and Valio pays all its operating profit to the owners through the cooperatives. \n\n\nDairy farm entrepreneurs can choose from the following actions to collect an additional cent per milk litre:\n\n\nAnimal grazing and access to outdoor activity \n\n\n\n\nGrazing, outdoor exercise, outdoor access in winter for different groups of animals\n\n\n\n\nMeasures to support biodiversity\n\n\nBiodiversity area\n\n\n\n\nCultivation of crops that benefit agrobiodiversity, in particular those suitable for pollinators\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental agreements\n\n\n\n\nThe entrepreneur manages a contract area (e.g. traditional biotope, natural pasture, field border of high natural value in terms of biodiversity or landscape importance) in accordance with an environmental contract, or a traditional biotope management contract under the Helmi Habitats Programme. \n\n\n\n\nReducing the carbon footprint\n\n\n\n\nUsing and updating Valio Carbo® Farm calculator reporting \n\n\nCompleting carbon farming training\n\n\nUsing carbon farming practices in the farm’s production of feed \n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio’s Sustainability Report 2022 has been published. The report is a compilation of the achievements, goals and development targets of our ambitious sustainability work. The Sustainability Report covers current information about the progress of our climate programme, our work on biodiversity, energy efficiency at our plants, and the wellbeing of people and animal welfare.\n\n\nValio’s sustainability measures progressed purposefully during 2022. Our goal is to cut the carbon footprint of milk to zero\n \nby 2035. We are reducing emissions, growing carbon sinks and creating circular economy solutions. We are improving animal welfare, and we are working to increase biodiversity. Here are some highlights of our sustainability work in 2022. \n\n\nDairy farm emissions measured with certified Valio CARBO® Farm calculator\n\nMore than 1,900 Valio dairy farms have reported their raw milk carbon footprint to Valio with the CARBO® Farm calculator. Carbon footprint reporting covers about 60 per cent of Valio’s milk intake. When the farm-specific baseline and emissions sources are known, the measures to reduce emissions can be targeted more accurately.\n\n\nBiggest energy efficiency investment in Valio’s history in Lapinlahti\n\n\nThe biggest energy efficiency investment in Valio’s history was completed at Valio’s Lapinlahti plant: a flue-gas condenser recovers heat from the plant’s chimney and decreases energy consumption by over 10 per cent. The heat recovery system received the “Energy Genius of the Year 2022” award.\n\n\nWe developed indicators to measure animal welfare\n\n\nWe participated in the development of a completely new set of indicators to measure the welfare of dairy farm cattle. The method monitors the welfare of calves and cows through various indicators, such as behaviour, cleanliness, nutritional status, and the prevalence of lameness and skin lesions. The set of indicators was created by animal welfare researchers from Natural Resources Institute Finland and the University of Helsinki, in cooperation with herd health veterinarians from Valio and partner organisations. \n\n\nPlan to start comprehensive biogas production is progressing \n\n\nValio and energy company St1’s joint venture, Suomen Lantakaasu Oy, is planning to build the first hybrid biogas production plant complex in Upper Savo, Finland. The plan advanced significantly in 2022. In addition to the industrial-scale biogas plant in Kiuruvesi, we started planning three medium-sized biogas plants in nearby areas. To realise these four biogas plants, we received investment support of EUR 19.2 million. The Ministry of Employment and the Economy’s funding decision is conditional, as it is subject to approval by the European Commission. The aim is that in 2026 the biogas plants will be generating a total of 120 GWh of renewable liquefied biogas suitable for heavy transportation. Its energy content is equivalent to 12 million litres of fossil diesel. \n\n\nNew packaging suitable for cardboard recycling \n\n\nWe expanded the range of cardboard cups. The amount of plastic was reduced significantly in some of the Valio PROfeel® protein quark and Oddlygood® cup products. The new packaging makes it easier to recycle them as cardboard. We will continue expanding the range in 2023. \n\n\nInvestments in mental health \n\n\nWe invested in mental health by adding brief psychotherapy to our regular occupational health services in Finland. Additionally, we piloted the Auntie Solutions service, which provides personalised, low-threshold support in life’s difficult moments. As recognition of our commitment to mental wellbeing, we were designated as a “Mental Health friendly Workplace” (Hyvän mielen työpaikka®) for the second time by the MIELI Finnish Association for Mental Health.\n\n\nYou can read more about Valio’s sustainability actions in \nValio’s Sustainability Report\n. \n\n"

        "text": "\n\nThe operating environment was turbulent in 2022: after the most acute phase of the long Covid-19 pandemic had subsided, Russia invaded Ukraine in February. In autumn, there was uncertainty regarding energy prices and availability. The year was marked by an unprecedented rise in production costs at farms and in the food industry, as well as general inflation. Despite the challenging operating environment, Valio continued the resolute implementation of its strategy. Valio Group net sales in 2022 were EUR 2,236 million, up by 15.6% on the previous year (EUR 1,934 million). With the business success, during the year Valio was able to raise the milk price paid to cooperatives by 36 per cent. \n\n\nDomestic net sales increased by 17.6 % and international net sales by 12.4%. Some of the growth is attributed to the acquisition of Heinon Tukku in summer 2021. Heinon Tukku was included in the 2021 comparison figures starting from the second half of the year. \n\n\nDairy farms faced an extremely tough year  \n\n\nValio is owned by some 3,700 Finnish dairy farms through cooperatives. Valio’s main purpose is to pay the best possible return to its owners, i.e. the dairy farms, through the cooperatives.  \n\n\nDairy farms faced an extremely tough year with, in some cases, manifold increases in fertiliser, energy and animal feed prices and significant increases in production costs at the farms. Problems also arose regarding the availability of some production inputs. At the same time, Valio’s industrial operations costs increased drastically as a result of, for instance, higher energy prices. \n\n\nValio’s financial success is measured with a milk margin* and a milk return**. The milk margin amounted to EUR 1,008 million (EUR 862 million), and the milk return was 52.5 cents per litre (43.7 c/l). The average price paid to the cooperatives for raw milk was 52.1 cents per litre (42.3 c/l). The price includes the after payments made to the cooperatives for 2022.   \n\n\n“Under these difficult circumstances, Valio was able to boost its operational efficiency, achieve cost savings and absorb the higher costs into its product pricing. The global market prices were also favourable. For these reasons, we generated a record milk return and were able to raise the milk price paid to cooperatives by a total of about 36 per cent. This is a major achievement in a very challenging market situation. All production plants operated normally throughout the year, and delivery reliability to customers remained at a good level,” Valio’s CEO \nAnnikka Hurme \nreflects on the year.    \n\n\nAt the end of 2022, there were about 3,700 Valio farms, i.e. some 300 fewer than in 2021. The vitality of dairy farms and their ability to continue operating in different situations is important in securing domestic food production. \n\n\n“Our goal is to secure the future of Valio dairy farms, both in medium and long term, and to ensure that milk production, which is particularly well suited to Finnish nature, remains in Finland,” Hurme continues.  \n\n\nInteresting, new and innovative products boosted Valio’s successes  \n\n\nValio’s vision is to be a trailblazer in innovative solutions and brands in the dairy and food industries. Our strongest strategic area is business operations focused on milk in the domestic market, and we will continue to further its development. Another important strategic focus is ingredients and solutions that generate value added for our industrial customers, through which we seek growth globally, for example in Asia. We are also targeting international markets with plant-based products. \n\n\nIn Finland, we grew our market share in, e.g., snack products, cheeses and plant-based products, and we launched numerous new products. We extended product families, such as Valio Herkku yoghurts and Valio PROfeel® snacks, and introduced new sliced cheese products. \n\n\nWe developed new, innovative baking and cooking products designed to make everyday life easier – using both milk and plant-based ingredients. New flavours were added to the Oddlygood® gurt and Oddlygood® Barista product ranges, and we launched vegan Oddlygood® Dreamy Desserts. \n\n\nValio’s exports account for about 25 per cent of Finland’s food exports \n\n\nNet sales from Valio’s international operations totalled EUR 832 million (EUR 740 million). Product exports from Finland to some 50 countries totalled about EUR 553 million. Valio’s exports accounts for about 25 per cent of Finland’s total food exports.  \n\n\nThe global market prices of international industrial products, such as industrial butter and skim milk powder, continued to increase in early 2022 and reached an exceptionally high level. They peaked in the spring and then began to fall. Uncertainties in the global economy, and in China in particular, as well as inflation weakened the global demand for butter and milk powder. \n\n\nInvestments in value added ingredients continued. The sales of both lactose free Valio Eila® and organic milk powders increased. \n\n\nIn China, net sales denominated in euros increased by 28 per cent compared with 2021. The growth originated mainly from the higher market prices for basic products, such as skim milk powder and whey powder. In the USA, net sales denominated in euros increased by 19 per cent. Our core business, Finlandia cheeses and butter, developed favourably. In Sweden, net sales denominated in euros increased by 17 per cent. Growth was generated by lactose free milk drinks, cooking products, and yoghurts, as well as Valio PROfeel® and Oddlygood® products. Net sales in Estonia increased by 29 per cent, with growth in all categories. \n\n\nOpenings in new business areas  \n\n\nAs part of our strategy, we continuously assess new business opportunities.  \n\n\nValio acquired Heinon Tukku in summer 2021, and in January 2022 the new wholesale business was renamed Valio Aimo®. The Covid-19 pandemic loosened its grip in the summer, and eating in restaurants increased. \n\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, Mandatum Asset Management became a minority shareholder in Oddlygood Global Oy. Growth financing will accelerate internationalisation. Oddlygood® net sales increased by 21 per cent on the previous year. New records were set for market share in Sweden, Finland, and the Baltics States, and sales were launched in Poland. \n\n\nIn February, we established a joint venture with St1 Oy, Suomen Lantakaasu Ltd. The joint venture is part of the practical implementation of our climate programme. In December, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment granted EUR 19.2 million in funding for the construction of Finland’s largest biogas plant complex in Kiuruvesi. The subsidy is conditional on approval from the European Commission.  \n\n\nIn March, we announced that Valio is buying the Gold&Green brand, as well as the intellectual property and R&D operations of Gold&Green Foods from the food company Paulig. We aim to hold an even stronger position in the growing plant protein markets. In the autumn, we launched new Gold&Green products and relaunched Nyhtökaura (Pulled Oats). \n\n\nIn 2022, we started a new performance improvement programme set to run to 2025; through the programme, we will look for new cost-conscious ways of working and we’ll focus on aspects such as reducing time wastage. \n\n\nValio’s operations in Russia ended in April  \n\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine in February made it both ethically and operationally impossible to continue Valio’s business in Russia. At the end of April, Valio completed negotiations on selling its Russian operations to Velkom Group. The sale was implemented immediately and Valio’s operations in Russia ended. The sale included Valio’s Russian business operations and the processed cheese plant in Ershovo. The Viola® processed cheese brand, produced and sold in Russia, was also included in the sale. \n\n\nRussian net sales accounted for around five per cent of Valio’s total net sales. Valio exports products to some 50 countries around the world, so we have spread the risk across different markets. Russia’s significance to Valio’s business operations was therefore not as great as in 2014, when exports to Russia were halted due to the invasion of Crimea and the ensuing sanctions imposed by the EU and Russia’s countersanctions. \n\n\nClimate programme advances  \n\n\nValio aims to cut the carbon footprint of milk to zero by 2035. Valio’s total emissions from operations in Finland (excl. wholesale functions) have decreased by 10 per cent from the 2019 base line to 2022. Valio complies with the international GHG Protocol and the emissions report is assured by a third party. The reporting covers scope 1–3 (emissions from Valio’s own operations, emissions from Valio’s purchased electricity and heat, and all other indirect emissions from Valio’s value chain).  \n\n\nDuring 2019-2022, emissions reductions of -42% were achieved in Valio's own operations (scope 1) and -34% in emissions from electricity and heat purchased by Valio (scope 2). All other indirect emissions in Valio’s value chain (scope 3) decreased by a total of 8%. Of these, the emission reductions during 2019-2022 were -9% for raw milk received and -20% for logistics. \n\n\nWe track the reduction in dairy farm greenhouse gas emissions with the CARBO® Farm calculator. More than 1,900 dairy farms have reported their raw milk carbon footprint to Valio. This accounts for about 60 per cent of our milk intake. We train dairy farmers in carbon farming methods to reduce climate emissions. By the end of 2022, we had trained about 1,000 farms, i.e. over 25% of all Valio’s farms.   \n\n\nIn 2022, the largest energy efficiency investment in Valio’s history was completed at the Lapinlahti plant: the new flue-gas condenser recovers heat from the plant’s chimney and reduces energy consumption by more than 10 per cent. \n\n\nYear 2023  \n\n\nThe operating environment remains volatile, and there is an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty in forecasting, e.g., global market prices for industrial products, consumer demand, and dairy farm and industry’s cost level. It continues to be a tough situation for dairy farms.  \n\n\nYear 2023 is continuing to progress along the guidelines of Valio’s strategy. Our goal is that strategic projects will generate new growth, improve operational efficiency and enhance profitability in the coming years. Valio’s main purpose is to pay the best possible return to the owners, i.e. dairy farms, through the cooperatives. \n\n\nIn the Suomen Lantakaasu Oy biogas plant project, a call for tenders for the construction and detailed planning of the plant will be launched. The goal is for the plant complex to start operations in 2026.  \n\n\nValio is updating the sustainability programme for dairy farms in May. In the future, farms can receive an additional price for their milk by giving cows grazing and outdoor opportunities, for farming that supports biodiversity and for efforts to reduce the farm’s carbon footprint. The reform is significant for agriculture overall in Finland, as around 80 per cent of the milk produced in the country is covered by Valio’s sustainability programme. \n\n\nRead Valio’s Sustainability Report and Board of Directors’ Report and Financial Statements 2022: \nReports and Financial Statements | Valio\n\n\nValio Group’s key figures in 2022 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n \n\n\n2021\n \n\n\nChange\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet sales, MEUR \n\n\n 2,236 \n\n\n 1,934 \n\n\n 16% \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk margin, MEUR \n\n\n1,008 \n\n\n 862  \n\n\n 17% \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk return, c/l \n\n\n 52.5 \n\n\n 43.7 \n\n\n 20% \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk volume, ML \n\n\n1,682 \n\n\n1,723 \n\n\n -2% \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity assets ratio \n\n\n 49% \n\n\n 48% \n\n\n  3% \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments, MEUR \n\n\n 55 \n\n\n 56 \n\n\n -3% \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n*Milk margin, MEUR:  \n\n\nNet sales less all other costs excluding the price paid to the co-operatives for raw milk, interest on shareholder loans, depreciation according to plan, supplementary payments to the pension fund, pension contribution refunds, and items not included in actual business operations, such as sales gains from sales of business operations, provisions, sales gains and losses from real estate sales, write-offs of non-current assets, costs arising from acquisitions of companies and business operations, and subsidiaries' minority interest of the profit.

The dry blend-optimized product offers infant milk formula (IMF) manufacturers a more straightforward production process while ensuring the highest microbiological quality.\n\n\nValio Prime SMP is a unique new product built on decades of award-winning research and development. With this latest innovation in a category where product launches are rare, Valio is already creating a buzz in the market.\n\n\nSkimmed milk powder that meets the strictest dry blending requirements in infant nutrition\n\n\nThe dry blending process enables manufacturers to flexibly customize their product selection to meet market needs. Valio Prime SMP is especially suited for small and medium-sized enterprises, as it is easy to incorporate into existing dry blend manufacturing processes, but larger manufacturers can also use it to streamline their production processes.\n\n\nDue to the absence of heat treatment after blending, the quality standards for dry blends are more stringent than those for wet blends. As a result, the ingredients must meet very high quality requirements, which can only be ensured by strictly limiting microbiological levels in the dry blending process.\n\n\n\"Valio Prime SMP is manufactured in Valio’s new ultraclean facilities using only fresh Finnish milk that is ranked among the cleanest in the world. This results in an exceptional skimmed milk powder with a high degree of microbiological purity,\" says Product Developer \nChristina Maksimow\n.\n\n\nVaried product portfolio encourages customers to innovate\n\n\nValio’s 70 years of expertise in infant nutrition and 40 years of experience in developing high-quality ingredients for IMF manufacturers form a great base for the experts in R&D to innovate and create new products that the customers need in the changing market environment.\n\n\n“Valio Prime SMP allows infant formula manufacturers to optimize their production processes and create exactly the kinds of blends they want for their products,” says Business Manager \nLaura Enbom\n.\n\n\nThe new milk powder also enables Valio to serve IMF manufacturers even better than before.\n\n\n“Valio Prime SMP is a real masterpiece in our already comprehensive IMF portfolio.

        "text": "\n\nValio is investing in eniferBio, a company with the technology to convert agricultural, forestry and food industry side streams into PEKILO® mycoprotein, a high-protein ingredient, for global food and animal nutrition markets. The funding will enable eniferBio to significantly scale up production of the domestic, sustainably produced PEKILO® mycoprotein powder. In addition to Valio, the Dutch Aqua-Sparks, and the Finnish Tesi, Voima Ventures and Nordic Foodtech VC also took part in eniferBio’s Series A round of financing.\n\n\nGlobal protein consumption is estimated to double by 2050. The UN predicts the global population to grow to 9.7 billion by 2050, according to the 2015 population projection. As the food demand grows, it also must be produced with half of today’s emissions. That means new alternatives are needed to secure the protein demand in the production of food and animal nutrition.\n\n\n“Alongside traditional food production, we need new, circular economy-aligned ways to produce food. Food produced through cellular agriculture will play a significant role in future food production. The animal nutrition industry’s need for sustainably produced protein is also growing. eniferBio is the leading expert in its sector and has developed new ways to utilise the food industry’s side streams in the production of protein. We are excited to be more actively involved in the development of new means of food production for the globally growing demand,” says Valio’s \nTuomas Salusjärvi\n, Executive Vice President, Growth Business and R&D.\n\n\nPEKILO®, a Finnish innovation and the world’s first mycoprotein product, was originally developed back in the 1970s. Just like conventional animal-based proteins and soy or pea proteins, PEKILO® is also very suitable for human consumption. The high nutritional value fungus, i.e. mycoprotein powder, can be used as a feed- and food-grade ingredient in many products. \n\n\nMycoprotein can be produced efficiently from agricultural and forestry side streams and food industry by-products. It contains up to 70% protein, 20–30% fibre, 10% unsaturated fats and minerals, and is rich in vitamin B. The production process is efficient and uses very little energy, water and land area, and it doesn’t eutrophicate water bodies. \n\n\n“We are grateful to Valio and other investors for their support in commercialising the alternative protein. They bring a huge amount of information, understanding and industry contacts,” says eniferBio’s CEO and Co-founder \nSimo Ellilä. \n\n\nValio has been involved in studying cellular agriculture opportunities since 2021 and started collaborating with eniferBio on research related to PEKILO® protein in 2022.\n\n\nIn the first phase, eniferBio has developed the PEKILO® mycoprotein powder for use in the food industry and animal nutrition.\n \nThe next phase together is to develop products using PEKILO® protein. \n\n\n“We have a product that turns today’s waste into a high-value ingredient. We can provide the world’s most competitive protein production process and a product that has been tested on an industrial scale for over 15 years. We are now ready for the next phase of scaling our production and product use cases,” Ellilä concludes.\n\n"

The study is conducted annually in Finland and other European countries. The results show that Finnish consumers particularly value Valio’s domestic food production, healthy and high-quality products, and our work to improve animal welfare and the climate.\n\n\n“For us, it is a great honour that Finnish consumers again perceive Valio as Finland’s most sustainable brand. We accept this recognition with sincere gratitude. Sustainability is earned through actions, not words. The perception about Valio as a responsible company is built every day, in every encounter, through Valio people and our products. Especially today in the midst of a turbulent and changing world, it is even more important to ensure that the operations of companies withstand critical scrutiny,” says Valio’s CEO \nAnnikka Hurme\n\n\n“The interest in sustainability shows signs of increasing among Finnish consumers.

In the future, more food must be produced on fewer hectares of arable land than today. At the same time, the environmental and climate impacts of food production must be significantly decreased. We want to be a part of the solution to challenges: we are aware of our environmental and climate impacts, and we are taking active measures to reduce them through regenerative farming and carbon farming in grasslands, the production of manure-based biogas, energy efficiency and emissions reduction actions at plants, and emissions reduction measures at the farm level. At the same time, we are determined to improve animal welfare and the wellbeing of people,” says \nHanna Hiekkamies\n, Valio’s Senior Vice President, Group Sustainability.\n\n\nValio is a cooperative that is owned by 3,700 Finnish dairy farmers; it pays out all its profits to the dairy farms. The fact that Valio’s products and production are local is important to Finns. When choosing a Valio product, you can be sure that the money stays in Finland, on Finnish dairy farms. \n\n\n“We will continue our ambitious work to zero milk’s carbon footprint by 2035 and to improve the welfare of animals and the wellbeing of people,” says Hanna Hiekkamies.  \n\n\nThe Sustainable Brand Index study measures people’s perceptions about brands, not the progress or success of the brands’ sustainability actions.

        "text": "\n\nValio, A-Rehu, Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) and the University of Helsinki are researching the potential for reducing ruminal methane emissions using a feed additive; the ‘Climate smart feeding solutions for Finnish milk production sector’ project is funded by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The Bovaer® feed additive can reduce ruminal methane emissions by 30 percent and thus promotes climate resilience in agriculture. In the joint project, the methane-reducing feed additive is being piloted with 3,100 dairy cows at 43 farms.\n\n\nValio and A-Rehu were the first in Finland to test the Bovaer® feed additive, in 2022. It is the first additive approved in EU to reduce ruminal methane emissions. According to DSM, the product manufacturer, its use reduces ruminal methane emissions by up to 30 percent. \n\n\nA three-month follow-up pilot launched in early 2023 has expanded the use of the feed additive to a total of 3,100 dairy cows at 43 farms. The pilot is addressing practical challenges and needs so that the special feed could be made widely available to different dairy farms in Finland in the future.\n\n\nIn addition to the dairy farm pilot, a study is currently underway at Jokioinen research barn of Natural Resources Institute Finland to determine what impact the feed additive has on the amount of cow methane emissions and on diurnal variation. \n\n\n“The 3-Nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) contained in the Bovaer® product is being used for the first time in Finland under research conditions where methane generation can be measured. This will provide information about the feed additive’s methane reduction potential with a diet based on ample grass silage, which is typical for Finnish cows. Bovaer® is currently the best available means to quickly and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from milk production, and it would contribute to the achievement of Finland’s carbon neutrality target,” says Research Professor \nMarketta Rinne \nfrom\n \nNatural Resources Institute Finland.\n\n\nThe project is also mapping other dietary means to reduce ruminal methane emissions in the future.\n\n\nMethane’s warming impact in the atmosphere can be significantly reduced already in the barn\n\n\nMethane, like carbon dioxide, is a greenhouse gas. Its climate warming effect in the atmosphere is shorter, but it is 28 times more potent compared to carbon dioxide. In the atmosphere, methane breaks down into carbon dioxide in about 10 years, reducing its additional warming effect. \n\n\n“Methane accounts for about 50 percent of the climate emissions from dairy farms. The methane generated in the cow’s rumen can be reduced with innovations in feed, for instance. Additionally, new technologies are being explored to either break down or capture methane in barn air. This can significantly reduce climate emissions from milk and meat production,” says \nJuha Nousiainen\n, Valio’s Senior Vice President who heads the Climate programme.\n\n\n“Feed can impact the generation of methane. With the Bovaer® feed additive, we can achieve a greater methane reduction than with other solutions currently in use. A-Rehu has conducted long-term feed development work in order to be the first in Finland to enable the use of Bovaer® in cow feed,” says A-Rehu’s \nMilja Heikkinen\n, Development Manager of cattle feeds\n.\n\n\n“The composition of the feed impacts the effectiveness of the means used to reduce methane production,” notes \nTuomo Kokkonen\n, Senior University Lecturer, Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Helsinki. A dairy cow feed study scheduled to start in autumn 2023 at the University of Helsinki will examine the methane reduction potential of the Bovaer® feed additive based on a diet of grass silage and whole-crop cereal silage.\n\n\nFacts about methane:\n\n\n\n\nThe share of methane generated in the digestive process of production animals accounts for about one third, i.e. 2.1 million tonnes CO\n2\ne, of Finland’s effort sharing sector emissions. Methane generated by ruminants accounts for about 40 percent of this, so feed solutions developed to reduce the methane have major potential to advance agriculture’s climate targets. \n\n\nOne cow generates about 150 kilos of methane per year. \n\n\nAbout 18-22 grams of methane per milk kilo is generated, calculated from calf to adulthood. The methane produced in the rumens of dairy cows accounts for about 2.5 percent of Finland’s greenhouse gases.\n\n\nThe methane generated in the rumen originates from the fodder crops that cows feed on.\n\n\nPlants use the carbon dioxide in the air in the photosynthesis process, and then form various carbon compounds, like sugars, fibres, proteins and fatty acids, for their own growth. Cows get nutrients from these, so some of the carbon in the feed that cows eat returns to the atmosphere as methane.  \n\n\nThe methane from cow belching breaks down into carbon dioxide in about 10 years in the atmosphere; the carbon dioxide is re-used by plants for photosynthesis, and the carbon cycle starts again. This is called the biogenic carbon cycle.\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio and VTT, Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd, are participating in an international research project exploring the use of plasma technology to capture the methane in barn air and break it down into carbon dioxide. In Finnish conditions, the methane emissions generated in conjunction with milk production account for about 50 percent of milk’s carbon footprint. The goal of the research project is to develop equipment that can convert the greenhouse gas methane that is captured from barn air into less harmful carbon dioxide.\n\n\nIn milk production, methane is generated in the cow’s rumen in conjunction with digestion and in the handling and storage of manure at dairy farms. Like carbon dioxide, methane is a greenhouse gas, but with a shorter, 28 times more potent warming effect on the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. In the atmosphere, methane decomposes into carbon dioxide in 10–12 years.  \n\n\nThe EU area has about 1.8 million cattle farms with a total of approx. 77 million cows producing 158 MT CO\n2\ne of methane per year. Agriculture accounts for 10 percent of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, and methane generated by ruminants accounts for 43 percent of emissions from agriculture. The European Union Fit for 55 package aims for carbon neutrality in the agriculture sector by 2035. Achieving the target will require fast and cost-effective solutions.\n\n\n“Our goal is to develop a new, eco-friendly, cost-effective technological solution that captures and breaks down the methane in barn air. This would enable us to cut the amount of barn air methane that ends up in the atmosphere by as much as 90 percent. When we convert the methane released in barn air into carbon dioxide, the more potent warming effect of methane is decreased. This, in turn, reduces the climate impacts of milk production by an estimated 30–40 percent,” says \nJuha Nousiainen\n, Valio’s Senior Vice President who heads the Climate programme. \n\n\nCold plasma technology can reduce methane’s warming effect already at the barn\n\n\nOf the several gases in barn air, methane accounts for a very small fraction: some hundreds of parts per million. One cow produces about 15 kilograms of methane in a year. Early this year, the research project headed by VTT started measuring and identifying the gas mixture in barn air. The measuring is taking place at Valio’s Arvela dairy farm in Pöytyä, Finland, where there are 240 cows. Among the participants in the EU-funded, four-year CANMILK project are top universities, researchers and knowledge transfer partners from Belgium, England, Germany, and The Netherlands.\n\n\nCold plasma is present in many everyday things and phenomena, such as fluorescent tubes and in the sky creating northern lights. Cold plasma is formed when electrons in the gas become hot enough. \n\n\n“Cold plasma is used to break down methane by exciting the gas molecules in the barn air to react with the methane. This is done using electricity in a unit located outside the barn,” says Senior Advisor \nPekka Simell\n from VTT.\n\n\nDeveloping new technology to control methane emissions is significant also on global level because reducing agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions is necessary. \n\n\nValio’s ambitious climate programme consists of concrete actions to cut milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. This means that an equal amount of greenhouse gases generated in milk production is sequestered by 2035.\n\n\nAtmospheric methane breaks down into carbon dioxide in about 10–12 years. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is sequestered in plants and soil through photosynthesis. Like forests, grasses sequester and store carbon in their roots. Carbon dioxide is stored in grass as carbohydrates. When a cow eats grass, ruminates and burps, the carbon stored in the grass is released into the atmosphere as methane; the methane breaks down into carbon dioxide in 12 years – and re-emerges in plants through photosynthesis. \n\n\n“It is clear that agricultural emissions must be significantly reduced. There are several alternatives, and not all methods have been invented yet. Cows enable us to produce high-quality food products also in northern regions where grass grows well but food crops do not produce sufficient yields. The trade-off for this is the methane emissions generated by the cows. However, we have several good possibilities for significantly reducing methane in the years to come. Methane capture and decomposition technology will help us get closer to our goal,” Juha Nousiainen sums up.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio’s packages with caps will change to tethered caps step by step. Drinkable products with caps will be gradually changed to comply with the requirements of the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive. The aim of the directive is to reduce the amount of plastic litter in the environment, especially on ocean beaches, and to promote a circular economy. The change will require that the caps of any beverage containers of up to three litres must remain attached to the carton. The first changes in Valio’s packaging will be visible in the first half of 2023. All the necessary changes will be done by the deadline set in the directive, i.e. before July 2024.\n\n\nThe aim in the EU is to reduce the amount of plastic litter ending up in the environment and to promote a circular economy. The first step was to ban single-use plastic plates, cutlery, and straws in July 2021 among other requirements. The scope of the directive expands on July 3, 2024, to require tethered caps on beverage packages of up to three litres. \n\n\nThe change impacts the majority of Valio’s liquid product containers of up to three litres that have a plastic cap, in all about two hundred Valio products, like milk, cream, sour milk, cooking creams, smoothies, porridges and berry soups. \n\n\n“The change has required a lot of preparation and planning, both internally and with our packaging suppliers. The change will lead to equipment investments at our factories, depending on the type of packaging. From the recyclability perspective, we believe that it’s very important for all recyclable materials – including plastics caps – to be recycled and reused. This will also help to ensure that plastic caps are collected and will not end up in the environment,” says Valio’s Packaging Development Manager \nJussi-Pekka Lumme.\n \n\n\nCaps are a packaging innovation that makes everyday life \neasier\n for many \n\n\nThe plastic caps on liquid product packages sometimes spark debate both for and against. Valio has conducted multiple surveys about the packaging preferences of Finnish consumers. Based on the survey results, many people don’t want to see an end to packages with caps, like milk cartons.\n\n\n“There are advantages to a package that can be sealed tight with a cap: it is readily portable, and it can be stored on its side in a refrigerator. All Valio gable-topped milk, sour milk, cream and yogurt products sold in Finland, including their caps, are made from 100% renewable raw materials. The plastic parts of the packaging are not fossil-based; they are made from bioethanol, a by-product of the sugarcane industry. Also, the traditional pourable carton is still functional, and many prefer this alternative,” notes Jussi-Pekka Lumme.\n\n\nThe packaging renewal will also lead to a change in the recycling instructions on a milk carton. The packaging that includes the cap will have to be recycled with carton\n \nrecycling. The plastic will be separated from the carton board at the recycling plant. During the recycling process, the carton packaging is soaked, the soaked cardboard sinks, the plastic rises to the surface, and then the plastic parts can be separated.\n\n\n“We encourage consumers to recycle all packaging correctly. For instance, we have added easy-to-find, plain-language recycling instructions to our packaging. Recycling all parts of the packaging conserves natural resources and reduces the use of virgin plastic. It is estimated that the use of recycled plastic reduces a packages carbon footprint by 40–60 per cent compared to a product made from non-recycled, fossil-based plastic,” says Valio’s Head of Packaging Development \nJuhana Pilkama\n. \n\n\nPilkama notes that packaging at Valio is continuously being developed to make it better suited for a circular economy and to minimise climate impacts. Ideally, environmentally smart packaging is recycle-ready and made from renewable or recycled materials.\n\n\nValio’s goal is that by the end of 2025 all packaging is recycle-ready, i.e. it can be used to make new products.\n\n\n“Our goal is to reduce the overall environmental impacts in a smart way: the right kind of packaging protects products and prevents food waste, and packaging made from renewable or recycled materials reduces the carbon footprint of products. The carbon footprint of Valio’s packaging is typically about two per cent. We are working to zero milk’s carbon footprint by 2035,” Juhana Pilkama sums up. \n\n"

        "text": "\n\nSuomen Lantakaasu Oy, the joint venture of Valio and energy company St1, is planning to build Finland’s biggest biogas production plant in in Upper Savo, Finland. The Ministry of Employment and the Economy has granted EUR 19.2 million in funding for construction of Suomen Lantakaasu Oy’s biogas and liquefaction plant. The biogas plant will use dairy farm manure and agricultural by-products to produce renewable, liquefied biogas for use as transport fuel.\n\n\nSuomen Lantakaasu Oy aims to produce a total of 1 TWh of renewable transport fuel, which corresponds to a quarter of Finland’s biogas target by 2030. St1 will distribute the biogas through its own nationwide network of fuelling stations for heavy-duty vehicles. The planned annual production capacity of the first biogas production plant is 125 GWh, and the goal is for the plant to be operational by 2026.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Employment and the Economy’s funding decision is conditional, as it is subject to approval by the European Commission. The funding will come from Europe’s RRF Recovery and Resilience Facility. \n\n\nThe plant project has progressed steadily during the year, and with the award of the investment grant, the next step will be to start tendering for the construction of the plant and a more detailed plant design process. The project will advance to the investment decision phase once the environmental and construction permits have been issued. \n\n\nAt the moment, agricultural companies in the Upper Savo region are being pursued through letters of intent. The manure and agro-biomass they generate can be used to produce liquefied biogas. \n\n\n“We have been pleased with the positive reception in Upper Savo regarding our biogas plant plans. The farms in the region are interested in the project and, through the letters of intent, we have secured more than half of the manure feedstock required for the central plant. However, we still need more agricultural businesses in the region to become agro-biomass suppliers. There has also been interest in the areas around the potential satellite plants, and next year we will start signing these letters of intent. The goal is that the hybrid plant in Upper Savo will reach hundreds of farms,” says Director \nLeena Helminen\n, who is responsible for biogas business development at Valio.\n\n\nWhen realised, the biogas plant will bring significant investments, tax revenue and new economic activity to Upper Savo. The plant complex will provide employment, both directly and indirectly, e.g. to logistics operators in the region.  \n\n\nThe targeted production capacity of 1TWh would correspond to 100 million litres of traditional diesel and the production plant in Upper Savo would correspond to 12 million litres of diesel fuel. Thus, the biogas production will reduce food production and transport emissions. The biogas value chain also efficiently recycles nutrients and decreases nutrient run-off into water systems.  \n\n\nAdding to the interest for farms is the positive impact biogas production will have on farm profitability, as well as the measures improving the nutrient cycle.\n\n\nBiogas has the potential to grow its market share as a fuel for heavy transport \n\n\nBiogas produced from manure creates significant climate benefits and strengthens Finland’s energy and fuel self-sufficiency. Biogas has all the potential to quickly grow its market share as a fuel for heavy transport.\n\n\n“Market growth will enable the production projects and, at the same time, will increase Finland’s energy self-sufficiency in the transition to a low-carbon energy system. Biogas technology makes it possible to produce new renewable fuel for the market by utilising raw materials that would otherwise not be recovered,” says \nMatti\n Oksanen, \nDirector of St1’s Gas Business.\n\n\nBiogas production is part of Valio’s climate programme aiming to cut milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. Biogas also plays an important role in St1’s energy transition, and the company has invested heavily in biogas operations in the Nordic countries in recent years.\n\n\nFinland’s biggest biogas plant \n\n\nSuomen Lantakaasu’s plant, which is been planned for Upper Savo is a so-called hybrid plant. This means that there is one industrial-scale, centralised liquefied biogas production plant in Kiuruvesi and smaller satellite biogas plants in clusters of several farms elsewhere in the Upper Savo region\n\nThis will keep the biogas feedstock transport distances as short as possible. Suomen Lantakaasu will collect manure from farms and will provide the farms with the bio-fertiliser generated in the production of the biogas. The farm’s nitrogen fertiliser cost will decrease because the amount of soluble nitrogen in bio-fertiliser is up to 20-30 per cent higher than in manure.     \n\n"

There are huge expectations as leaders from around the world convene for the UN Biodiversity Conference COP15 in Montreal, 7–19 December 2022. Valio joins the more than 330 businesses and financial institutions in the Make it Mandatory campaign, calling for the mandatory assessment and disclosure of nature dependencies by large and multinational companies by 2030.\n\n\nThe aim at the COP15 biodiversity conference is to agree on global actions and targets to protect and restore biodiversity. \nHanna Hiekkamies\n, Senior Vice President, Group Sustainability at Valio, believes it is important that the Montreal conference agrees on a common set of rules by which companies assess their nature impacts. \n\n\n“It is important for us to participate in the Make it Mandatory campaign because we can impact biodiversity through collaboration. Along with other companies, we are calling for the mandatory reporting of nature dependencies by large and multinational companies by 2030. Valio already reports the nature impacts of milk production in its Sustainability Report, and we have created a biodiversity roadmap that compiles individual actions into a target-oriented package,” Hiekkamies says.\n\n\nFood production is entirely dependent on nature and its biodiversity. A loss of biodiversity undermines functions necessary for agriculture, like pollination and water and nitrogen cycling. To ensure the continuity of farming, we must stop the weakening of biodiversity.\n\n\n“We recognise our own impacts on nature. In fact, our key task is to increase biodiversity and to reduce the adverse impacts of our operations. In milk production, the nutrient load and the use of pesticides weaken biodiversity. But milk production also has many positive impacts in terms of nature. Continued grazing is vital for the conservation of biotypes and species in traditional habitats. And recycling manure nutrients can replace artificial fertilisers,” she adds.\n\n\nStrengthening biodiversity is an integral part of Valio’s climate programme, which aims to cut milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. Valio has created a biodiversity roadmap that charts the path towards increasingly biodiverse farming.\n\n\n“The new sustainability programme we are launching for milk producers in May 2023 will give farmers a sustainability bonus for strengthening biodiversity and for farm-level actions that mitigate climate change. Animal welfare continues to be an important part of our programme. The focus there is particularly on increasing grazing and the year-round pasturing of cows. Grazing maintains special habitats that benefit also endangered species,” says Hiekkamies. \n\n\nRead more about the Make it Mandatory campaign\n\n"

The new flue-gas condenser captures heat from the factory’s chimney and simultaneously scrubs it to make it cleaner. The factory’s energy consumption will decrease by more than 10 percent and its greenhouse gas emissions by about 10,000 CO2 tons per year, i.e. an amount equivalent to the annual emissions of some 4,900 passenger cars.\n\n\nThe Lapinlahti factory has the biggest total energy consumption of all Valio’s factories. The factory needs heat energy for two production processes in particular: drying milk powders and cooking cheese. The factory’s heat energy consumption can be decreased by as much as 25,000 MWh per year. \n\n\n“We produce the heat energy needed by our factory primarily using biofuel in a heat plant located on site. Hot flue-gas is generated in conjunction with heat production. Previously, the heat energy contained in the approx. 150°C flue gas went to waste, but now the flue-gas condenser captures the thermal energy. Water sprayed into the flue gas absorbs the thermal energy of the flue gas. This combined with the heat pump technology results in 80°C hot water, which we utilise in production and in facility heating. We store the rest of the hot water in the new heat accumulator system. This gives us access to thermal energy when we need it the most,” says Energy Manager \nPeter Fabritius\n from Valio.  \n\n\nIn addition to the energy savings, the system supports heat production especially during periods of peak consumption and reduces the use of light fuel oil-fired auxiliary boilers. It also lowers the factory’s energy bill. \n\n\n“Valio’s target is to cut milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. We have implemented a lot of energy-efficiency measures over the years. However, as a single measure, this is the most effective and tangible demonstration of the food industry’s sustainability work. The timing is right, as energy savings are needed now more than ever. Energy availability is a security of supply issue. Food factories must have continuous access to electricity in order to secure the Finnish food supply,” Fabritius concludes.  \n\n\nValio’s investment includes a flue-gas condenser, a heat pump system, a heat accumulator and an extension to the factory’s heat distribution network. Our partner Adven Oy, a provider of energy and water services, is responsible for operation and maintenance of the system.\n\n\n*Traficom: The average CO2 emissions from passenger cars on the road in 2021 was 147 g/km.

        "text": "\n\nDid you know that the milk chocolate of everyone's dreams does exist? Over a million milk chocolate lovers’ most delicious desires were curated with the power of artificial intelligence to create chocolate to please all. To fulfill people’s needs and respond to growing health challenges the milk chocolate of the future was created by a unique milk powder solution. “The Bar” is a milk chocolate landscape that combines all the changing preferences of people’s cravings while having 30% less sugar.  \n\n\nMilk being the core ingredient of chocolate, a Finnish dairy and food company Valio harnessed artificial intelligence to showcase the taste of the future. A new milk chocolate piece titled “The Bar” is designed by humans, and its recipe is based on AI analysis of milk chocolate lovers’ thoughts, cravings, and tastes around the world. Valio created the futuristic concept together with local chocolate artists of Kultasuklaa company, meaning that Valio itself has not switched to chocolate manufacturing. The Bar is a proof of concept of what the dairy company’s milk powder solution can do and how the future of milk chocolate could look like.\n\n\n“The needs and preferences of global milk chocolate fans are changing. Growing awareness of health challenges affect the confectionery industry with governments around the world already starting to regulate sugar use and consumption. With our Valio Bettersweet\n™ solution the taste remains the same even though the amount of sugar is reduced,” says \nValio’s Senior Vice President \nTimo Pajari\n.\n\n\nPioneering in the dairy industry requires constant learning on how technology can be utilized in product development of dairy ingredients. Last spring the company analyzed with artificial intelligence over 1.5 million public milk chocolate related social media discussions around the world and surveyed hundreds of people of their preferences regarding chocolate. The AI analysis was produced by the Finnish company Aiwo Digital in cooperation with Valio’s consumer insight team.\n\n\n“We wanted to unravel the most delicious and hidden desires of milk chocolate fans. By connecting the capabilities of AI, human craftsmanship and design with our milk powder know-how we were able to create the chocolate of the future. Observing and curating conversations on social media enabled us to draw conclusions of authentic consumer preferences,” \nsays Pajari.\n\n\nFive different layers for different use cases\n\n\nThe results showed silent signals and emerging milk chocolate trends with two main conclusions. First, there is no single favorite chocolate taste, filling, or size as consumers want to enjoy different kinds of milk chocolate in different situations. Second, people want to indulge in milk chocolate with good conscience. The taste and sweetness are very important but at the same time consumers want milk chocolate to be healthier and natural with less sugar.\n\n\nThe recipe for a healthier dream chocolate was based on AI’s findings: five different chocolates with less sugar. Each chocolate has a different taste and texture designed to fit a different use case: impulse, craving, delight, hunger and relaxation. From bite to bite new sensations get discovered and gradually build upon each other. The topographic design of the bar designed by professional designers allows the layers to be easily separated for enjoyment at the suitable time.\n\n\n“The Bar’s chocolate flavors form a new kind of alternative to the traditional chocolate box, where different chocolate flavors are combined together instead of separated. Each layer of milk chocolate is made for different situations in life. In addition to plain milk chocolate flavor the other layers are enhanced with nuts, coconut and cookie crumbs,”\n Pajari says.\n\n\nFuture milk chocolate has 30% less sugar with no change in taste\n\n\nTo answer the growing need for healthier and natural milk chocolate, The Bar’s milk chocolate has 30% less sugar than regular. It is also lactose-free. This is achieved without changing the sweet taste or texture of the milk chocolate by using Valio Bettersweet™ solution in the recipe. \n\n\nValio Bettersweet™ is a milk powder solution that enables natural sugar reduction in any milk chocolate product by using the proteins in milk reducing the need for added sugar. The 30% sugar reduction is just the beginning, as Valio already has solutions under development that can eliminate the amount of added sugar completely.\n\n\n“We see that future milk chocolate will have less sugar and only natural ingredients, without compromising the familiar taste. The Bar concept showcases how our Bettersweet\n™ \nmilk powder solution does exactly that, but also how we can utilize AI to create even better products to cater the changing needs and desires of customers. Wherever the chocolate landscapes of the future will develop, with Valio Bettersweet\n™\n it’s always made better\n,” Pajari says.\n\n\nRead more\n about The Bar, its natural recipe, great taste, and functional futuristic design on Valio’s website: \n\n"

Energy production in Riihimäki was converted to biofuels already before, and natural gas has been used for heating only in the coldest weather. Now the natural gas boilers are replaced by an electric boiler. Electricity produced with renewable energy helps Valio on its path towards carbon neutrality in the future.\n\n\nContinuous electricity distribution for food factories is a must in order for the Finnish food supply to run without interruptions. Valio’s dairy plants are generally in operation all the time, as milk is delivered to the factories every day around the clock. That’s why uninterrupted electricity supply is a prerequisite for the operation of Valio’s factories.\n\n\n“Natural gas has been in use in Riihimäki factories for a longer time with a small load, and in this kind of use, the efficiency of natural gas is poor. In addition, to Valio’s goal is to reset milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. This means phasing out fossil fuels such as natural gas “, says \nPeter Fabritius\n, Energy Manager at Valio.\n\n\nValio has two production plants in Riihimäki, a snack plant completed in 2017 and the Riihimäki dairy plant, which has been operating since the late 1960s, and was previously known as Herajoki dairy. The Riihimäki plant produces milk, buttermilk and cream. The new snack factory produces yogurt for domestic use and for export as well as plant based Oddlygood® goods. \n\n\nAt Riihimäki, electricity is needed in operating the equipment and in cooling the milk.

        "text": "\n\nIn the development of its packaging, Valio is investing in renewable packaging materials, reducing fossil plastics and improving recyclability. According to a recent packaging study* commissioned by Valio, people are increasingly interested in the responsible packaging of food products. Responsible packaging is assessed primarily by its recyclability. Many are also paying attention to suitability of the packaging size for their own use, to avoid food waste.\n\n\nFood product packaging must be eco-friendly, recyclable and easy to use. The various packaging materials and their sustainability are also of concern − why does paperboard packaging also have plastic and why does a milk carton have a cap? And the recycling of materials can be confusing, especially if one package has a mix of materials that can be sorted into different recyclable fractions, like plastic, cardboard and aluminium.\n\n\nAccording to \nJuhana Pilkama\n, Head of Packaging Development at Valio, eventually all Valio packaging will be produced from renewable or recycled materials, and they will be fully recyclable. Currently, about 73 percent of Valio’s product packaging sold in Finland is made from renewable or recycled materials, and 86 percent is fully compatible with the circular economy. \n\n\nValio PROfeel® protein quark snacks to be packaged in paperboard cups \n\n\n“We are replacing fossil plastics with renewable and recycled materials, like recycled plastics and paperboard,” says \nJuhana Pilkama\n.\n\n\nValio PROfeel® protein quark snacks are an example of changes in packaging: the plastic lids and plastic spoons are being removed from the packaging. Now the PROfeel® protein quark snacks are gradually switching to cups that are suitable for cardboard recycling. The first ones to be packaged in the new paperboard packaging will be this autumn’s new flavour, the sugar-free apple-cinnamon, and the sugar-sweetened strawberry, raspberry, blueberry and vanilla flavours. From now on, these packages can be rinsed and put into cardboard recycling.\n\n\n“By switching to paperboard cups in these products, we will reduce plastic use by a total of 46,000 kilos per year. This is the equivalent of some 2.2 million grocery store plastic bags,” Juhana Pilkama notes.\n\n\nThe packaging change will be phased in so that Valio can utilise the packaging materials it had already acquired and thus avoid packaging waste. The next protein quark snacks are expected to switch to paperboard cups in early 2023, and the goal is to get also other Valio PROfeel® products into paperboard cups as soon as possible.\n\n\nThe amount of plastic will be reduced, but it can’t be totally replaced \n\n\nAll paperboard packaging has a thin plastic film to ensure that a liquid product remains inside the packaging and stays fresh. \n\n\n“Packaging must be designed to protect the product from spoiling. Plastic can be made also from renewable raw materials or from recycled plastic raw materials. For example, all Valio’s gable-topped cartons, including the cap, are made from 100 percent renewable materials. The cap and the thin plastic film are made from bioethanol, a by-product of the sugarcane industry. The cap preserves the shelf-life of the product and thus reduces food waste. The cap can be recycled with plastic recycling. \n\n\n“To facilitate recycling, we have also included recycling instructions on our packaging. Going forward, we will be communicating more about the sustainability aspects of our packaging materials,” says Juhana Pilkama.\n\n\n*Study on Significance of packaging and responsibility, Foodwest, 04/2022\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nMethane emissions in milk production fell in 1960–2020 by an overall 57 per cent, and by 35 per cent for each litre of milk. This reduction is achieved through improved production capacity, health and feeding for the animals, as well as reduced herd sizes. Milk production’s methane emissions in Finland account for 50 per cent of milk’s carbon footprint. Roughly 85–95 per cent of dairy’s carbon footprint is generated in primary production. It is still possible to further reduce the volume of methane.\n\n\nIn milk production, methane is generated in the cow’s rumen as it digests food, as well as when the farm processes and stores manure. Methane, like carbon dioxide, is a greenhouse gas, with a shorter life in the atmosphere, roughly ten years, but with an impact that is 28 times higher. In the atmosphere, methane dissolves into carbon dioxide in 10–12 years. \n\n\nAccording to recent studies*, methane emissions from Finland’s milk production have fallen by 57 per cent in 60 years. In part, this reduction can be explained through smaller number of cows, as well as with improved production capability, care and higher-quality feeding.\n\n\n“Compared to the 1960s, cows today can produce more milk with the same amount of feed. The volume of methane per kilo of feed has fallen, as the micro-synthesis in the cows’ rumens has improved, and the type of fermentation has changed. Total milk production volumes were at their peak in 1965, with 3,650 million kilos produced, which resulted in 110 million kilos of methane. In 2020, the numbers fell to 2,300 million kilos of milk and 48 million kilos of methane. Total methane production has therefore fallen by 57 per cent,” says the Natural Resources Institute’s Senior Advisor, Professor \nPekka Huhtanen\n.\n\n\nMethane produced by ruminants is circulating carbon\n\n\nA cow burps roughly 450 grams of methane per day. Roughly 20 grams of methane is produced per kilo of milk, when the growth of a calf into an adult animal is considered. Unlike methane in fossil fuel production such as oil drilling or coal mining, methane in milk production is so-called circulating carbon, the formation of which begins with carbon dioxide that’s already in the atmosphere. The source of the gasses in fossil fuel production is the Earth’s crust, where it has been stored for millions of years.\n\n\n“Grass plants bind atmospheric carbon dioxide, cows eat the grass, use it as energy and transform it into milk, releasing methane, which is transformed into carbon dioxide, back into the atmosphere. If the number of dairy cows does not change, the amount of methane in the atmosphere will find a balance, in which cows produce an amount of methane that will naturally dissolve and not create an additional warming effect. The methane currently in the atmosphere produced by Finnish dairy cattle is roughly half of what methane they did at their peak in the 1960s,” says Pekka Huhtanen.\n\n\nPossible methane reduction of 30–40 per cent in next 15 years\n\n\nChanges in feeding can reduce the creation of methane in a cow’s digestive system. For example, using plant oils and oats can result in a 5-10 per cent reduction. \n\n\n“Feed additives such as the one containing 3-Nitrooxypropanol that has being piloted on Valio farms can reduce methane emissions by up to 25–30 per cent from current levels. In the long term, reductions can be achieved by enhancing feed use through animal breeding and by increasing a cow’s lifetime production. These actions would also reduce emissions other than methane and improve the production economy. Using manure as a material for biogas would reduce methane emissions by another five per cent,” says director \nJuha Nousiainen\n who is responsible for Valio’s climate program.\n\n\nRuminants help us produce high-quality food products on Nordic fields, which grow grass well but cannot always support a good, high-quality harvest of food plants for humans. Roughly half Finland’s fields are like this, and therefore grass-based food production also makes sense from a security of supply perspective. \n\n\n“We must strive to reduce methane emissions from all sources,” says Juha Nousiainen.  \n\n\nBackground information:\n\n\n\n\nMilk production’s share of Finland’s entire greenhouse gas load has remained at 3–4% for the entirety of the 2000s (Statistics Finland 2017).\n\n\nMethane emissions account for roughly half milk’s carbon footprint in Finland’s conditions, and the methane expelled by dairy cattle accounted for 2.5 per cent of Finland’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2020.\n\n\nThis methane inventory was carried out by compiling cow and production numbers and cow weights from official statistics gathered in 1960–2020. The cow replacement rate was calculated based on herd size, and feed content was determined from feed usage data. Feed usage was determined from the produced milk volume and feeding norms. Methane production was determined based on feed content and usage with the Nordic Karoline dairy cow model. Future methane reduction scenarios were modelled with the Lypsikki® dairy farm model**.\n\n\n\n\n*Methane production inventory between 1960-2020 in the Finnish Dairy sector and the future mitigation scenarios.

        "text": "\n\nValio is updating its sustainability bonus programme for dairy farms on 1.5.2023. Going forward, farms can receive additional pay per milk litre for grazing their cattle and giving them access to outdoor activity, for farming practices supporting biodiversity, and for efforts aiming to reduce the farm’s carbon footprint. The renewal is significant also in the big picture of agriculture because about 80% of the milk produced in Finland is within the sphere of Valio’s sustainability bonus programme. After the update, Valio will pay its dairy farmer owners, through cooperatives, nearly 50 million euros for actions exceeding the statutory requirements.\n\n\nValio launched the sustainability bonus programme in 2018 to encourage dairy farms to carry out sustainability actions that go beyond the statutory requirements. So far, the farms have received the bonus for actions improving animal welfare. Meeting the criteria has required, e.g., veterinarian visits, planned healthcare for cows and systematic monitoring of welfare. The healthcare of the cattle is monitored through the national and certified Naseva, the Centralised Health Care Register for Finnish Cattle Herds. \n\n\n“The goal we set four years ago was for all Valio dairy farms to commit to the sustainability bonus programme actions to improve animal welfare by 2021. Now that the original goal has been achieved, we are further developing the sustainability bonus programme. Going forward, dairy farms will receive a sustainability bonus also for farm actions that strengthen biodiversity and mitigate climate change. Animal welfare continues to be an important theme, and now we will focus particularly on increasing grazing and year-round outdoor activity for cows,” says \nIlkka Pohjamo\n, Senior Vice President, Primary Production at Valio.\n\n\nThe new actions are voluntary for farms, and the idea is that each farm will choose the actions that are right for them. Previously, the sustainability bonus was two cents per litre of milk; now it will be possible for farms to earn an additional cent by combining various actions. For example, the average size farm of 45 cows currently receives a sustainability bonus of 8,000 euros. With the programme update, it’s possible to increase the bonus to 12,000 euros.\n\n\nAiming for increased outdoor activity and grazing for cows\n\n\nMore than 70% of Valio farms graze their cattle, and about 80 percent of the farms have either pasturage or exercise yards. Valio’s intention is that grazing and outdoor activity are significantly increased in the future. \n\n\n“Cows can move about freely year-round in a freestall barn, but the animals can’t get outside to graze on all farms. The sustainability bonus will incentivize more and more farms to arrange outdoor activity for cows. Grazing is not only good for the cows, it’s also good for biodiversity because grazing cows and the manure they leave in the pasture attract many kinds of insects, which in turn are food for birds. For instance, where there are cows, there are also swallows.”\n\n\nSo why don’t all farms pasture their cows?\n\n\n“One reason might be that there is a road between the barn and the pasture, impeding the cows’ access the pasture. In years past, pasture planning wasn’t necessarily taken into account when building a new barn. These days, access to pasturing is considered in the design phase of new barn projects. So this is another area where we are moving in the right direction,” Pohjamo says.\n\n\nAnother example Pohjamo mentions is the issues linked to Valio’s climate programme.\n\n\n“Our goal is to cut milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. A large share of milk’s carbon footprint originates in primary production at dairy farms, and that’s why it is important that the farms have tools to monitor the decrease in their own carbon footprint and take the necessary actions. Already some 1,200 farms have started using the Valio Carbo® calculator to calculate their carbon footprint, and close to 650 dairy farms have taken part in carbon farming training. Going forward, a bonus can be received by calculating the carbon footprint and implementing carbon farming measures.”\n\n\nValio is owned by ca. 4,000 Finnish dairy farms through regional cooperatives, and Valio pays all its operating profit to the owners through the cooperatives. Valio has managed to keep the raw milk price paid to the cooperatives higher than the average European price. Valio has increased the milk price it pays to the cooperatives by 10.5 cents since October 2021.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio Group net sales in 2021 were EUR 1,918 million, up 6.1% on the previous year (EUR 1,808 million). Domestic net sales increased by 10.9 percent, and international net sales fell by 0.7 percent. The coronavirus pandemic affected domestic consumption and was visible in the growth in retail sales. HoReCa sales increased considerably with the acquisition of Heinon Tukku. In the challenging situation, the successful business operations enabled Valio to keep the raw milk price paid to the cooperatives higher than the average European price. The milk return increased, as in previous years. In April 2022, the basic raw milk price paid to the cooperatives was 8.5 cents higher than in the previous year.\n\n\nValio improved its profitability and recorded a good financial performance in 2021, despite the fact that a second consecutive year of coronavirus impacted Valio’s operations in all markets. At the same time, the dairy product business continued to strengthen: in the domestic dairy market Valio focused on its much-loved consumer brands, and in international markets on value-added ingredients for industrial customers.\n\n\nRetail sales growth and the acquisition of Heinon Tukku boosted domestic net sales\n\n\nValio’s domestic net sales were EUR 1,178 million (EUR 1,062 million). The coronavirus pandemic increased retail sales and our hotel, restaurant and catering (HoReCa) business. People cooked a lot at home, and retail sales continued to grow on the previous year. Eating at restaurants increased in the summer when restrictions were loosened and diners returned to the cities and their workplaces. HoReCa sales increased considerably compared to 2020.\n\n\nValio also carried out many strategic undertakings: The Heinon Tukku acquisition, the letter of intent on the production of manure-based biogas with St1 Oy, and the spin-off of the business operations of Valio Oddlygood® plant-based products.\n\n\n “I am especially proud of the fact that we were able for the second consecutive coronavirus year to grow our net sales, strengthen our result, and advance our strategy with determination. We succeeded in securing our employees’ health and, despite the challenging conditions, our personnel managed to keep all Valio’s factories operating normally throughout the year; delivery reliability to customers continuously exceeded 99 per cent,” says Valio’s CEO \nAnnikka Hurme\n.  \n\n\nThe new and innovative Valio PROfeel® puddings set new sales records and sliced cheeses continued to gain market share. Valio Oltermanni® and Monterey Jack cheeses and the Valio Oddlygood® Barista oat drink cinnamon roll flavour became hugely popular. \n\n\nStronger demand for international industrial products\n \n\n\nNet sales from international operations totalled EUR 740 million (EUR 746 million). Growth was particularly strong in Sweden, where net sales grew by around 10 percent. Growth stemmed especially from cooking products, Valio Oddlygood® products, snacks and Valio PROfeel® products.\n\n\nDemand for international industrial products, i.e. butter and milk powder, also was strong. By using value-added powders, a chocolate manufacturer, for instance, can reduce the sugar content of its products without changing the taste, or the powder has some other benefit for the customer. The most significant new products launched were Valio Eila® NUTRI F+ powder for the Korean company Maeil Dairies, and Valio Eila® Pro lactose-free skim milk powder as an ingredient for Nestlé’s baby food powder.\n\n\nIn China, sales continued to grow by about 16%, as in the previous year. In the United States, sales returned closer to the pre-pandemic level.\n\n\nAfter the close of the financial period, Valio announced on 7 March 2022 that it will discontinue its business operations in Russia. \n\n\nValio pays all its profit to its owners, the dairy farms \n\n\nValio is owned by 4,000 dairy farms, and Valio pays its operating profit to the dairy farms through four cooperatives. Valio’s financial success is measured with a milk margin* and a milk return**. The milk margin amounted to EUR 862 million (EUR 861 million), and the milk return stood at 43.7 cents per litre (41.5 c/l).\n\n\nValio switched to a contract production model at the beginning of 2021 in an effort to secure the future of dairy farms. Better predictability of the milk volume is necessary so that Valio can adjust its production capacity to market demand. In accordance with contract production, Valio’s milk procurement cooperatives supply a pre-agreed volume of raw milk to Valio. The average price paid for raw milk was 42.3 cents per litre (40.9 c/l). The price included after payments to dairy cooperatives for 2021. The sustainability bonus to encourage the continuous improvement of animal welfare remained at two cents per litre.\n\n\nAgriculture’s cost crisis also impacts Valio \n\n\nIn 2021, agriculture faced a drastic cost crisis that is still ongoing. Costs rose substantially in the latter half of the year in particular. The price of fertilisers more than doubled, and major increases were seen in energy and animal feed prices, for example. The higher costs put heavy pressure on dairy farms’ finances. The index of purchase prices for the means of agricultural production (Statistics Finland) hit its highest level in the 2000s.\n\n\nAt the same time, the war in Ukraine is further increasing the already record-high prices of fertilisers, energy and feed. The prices for packaging materials and other raw materials increased globally. With the successful business and the three-year cost savings programme that ended in 2021, Valio was able to increase the price paid for raw milk to the cooperatives by 2 cents per litre from November onwards. We also paid an extra 1.5 cents per litre for ordinary raw milk received in the first half of the year, plus an after payment of 1.2 cents per litre from January–December 2021.\n\n\nIn a challenging situation, successful business operations enabled Valio to keep the raw milk price paid to the cooperatives higher than the average European price in 2021. In April 2022, the basic raw milk price paid to the cooperatives was 8.5 cents higher than in the previous year (source: EU commission).\n\n\nScience-based climate targets\n\n\nValio’s target is to cut the carbon footprint of milk to zero by 2035. The science-based targets Valio set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Valio has committed to limiting the emissions of its production chain to the level required to keep the global temperature increase to a maximum of 1.5°C, in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Valio Finland’s overall emissions have decreased by about 6 per cent from 2019 to 2021. \n\n\nDairy farms now have access to the Carbo® environmental calculator that helps them measure their own carbon footprint and find the ways to reduce it. \nThe decrease of dairy farm greenhouse gas emissions are monitored with the CARBO® environmental calculator. \nMore than 1,000 farms, i.e. about a quarter of Valio’s dairy farms, calculated their carbon footprint during 2021.\n\n\nFinland’s first milk truck powered by biogas made from manure started operating in Haapavesi in March 2021. It fills its fuel tank with biogas at the Vuorenmaa dairy farm.\n\n\nAfter preparations made in 2021, Suomen Lantakaasu Oy, the joint venture established by Valio and St1, started operating at the beginning of 2022. The joint venture is part of the practical implementation of Valio’s ambitious climate programme. The company aims to process manure from farms into biogas for use by heavy vehicles. The biogas production will decrease fossil fuel emissions from transport, create new business for dairy farms, and increase energy self-sufficiency. \n\n\nAs of the beginning of 2021, all dairy farms met Valio’s sustainability criteria for animal welfare. The sustainability programme will expand in 2023 to cover new measures related to grazing, climate and biodiversity, in addition to the previous measures.\n\n\nEfficiency improvement programme exceeded its goal \n\n\nThe three-year programme introduced in 2018 to improve cost efficiency came to the end and exceeded the goals set for it. Improving profitability, competitiveness and cost efficiency will continue with the new four-year project.  \n\n\nYear 2022  \n\n\nYear 2022 is continuing to progress along the guidelines of Valio’s strategy. Our goal is that strategic projects will generate new growth for Valio, improve operational efficiency and enhance profitability in the coming years.\n\n\nThe operating environment is still extremely challenging. The global increase in costs is directly reflected in Valio’s production costs. The prices of, for example, the energy, packaging materials and other raw materials used by the plants have risen significantly, and the container shortage is increasing export freight costs. Dairy farms continue to be in an exceptionally difficult situation. Fertiliser and energy prices are expected to remain at record-high levels for at least the first half of the year. Feed prices will likely drop in the summer, when the new feed crop increases the supply of animal feed. \n\n\n“The coronavirus pandemic is now in its third year. It is important for us to look after the health of our personnel and to maintain production. Valio’s strength is that milk, the most important ingredient of our products manufactured in Finland, is produced locally, at Valio’s owners’ dairy farms. Products are manufactured in 12 plants, which helps to ensure the security of supply. We continue to prioritise people’s wellbeing, serving our customers in all our operations, and working together with cooperatives to support the dairy farms. Our task is to secure the future of Finnish agriculture and to take care of the domestic security of supply,” notes Annikka Hurme.\n\n\nValio Group’s key figures in 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n2020\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet sales, MEUR\n\n\n 1,918 \n\n\n 1,808\n\n\n  6.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk margin, MEUR\n\n\n 862\n\n\n 861 \n\n\n 0.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk return, c/l\n\n\n 43.7\n\n\n 41.5\n\n\n 5.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk volume, ML\n\n\n 1,723\n\n\n1,807\n\n\n -4.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity ratio\n\n\n 48%\n\n\n 50%\n\n\n -4.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments, MEUR\n\n\n 56\n\n\n 61\n\n\n -8.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Milk margin: Net sales less all other costs excluding the price paid to the cooperatives for raw milk, interest on shareholder loans, depreciation according to plan, supplementary payments to the pension fund, pension contribution refunds, and items not included in actual business operations, such as sales gains from sales of business operations, provisions, sales gains and losses from real estate sales, write-offs of non-current assets, and costs arising from acquisitions of companies and business operations.

        "text": "\n\nValio and Atria were the first in Finland early this year to test Bovaer®, a feed additive made by the Dutch company DSM. The additive has proved to reduce methane emissions produced by cows by 30 percent. The additive has generated promising results in farm trials in Europe and North America. During the 12-week test period, 400 cows at three different Valio dairy farms received feed containing the Bovaer® additive. Bovaer® recently received permission to be marketed in the EU.  \n\n\nThe feed trial carried out by Valio and Atria’s subsidiary A-Rehu is the first time that the Bovaer® additive has been used in feeding dairy cows in Finland. The goal of the pilot was to collect practical experiences on the use of the additive in feeding cows.  \n\n\n“During the pilot period, the cows’ milk production remained normal and no changes were detected in the composition of the milk. Nor was anything unusual detected in the cows’ behaviour and welfare. Based on the results of the pilot, the additive can be safely added to the cow feed,” says Valio’s Juha Nousiainen, Senior Vice President, Carbon-neutral Milk Chain.   \n\n\n“The additive has been studied around the world for a decade and is used in South America. There are extensive feed trials underway in Europe, New Zealand and Canada. The Finnish farms participating in the pilot were openly interested in the feed trial,” notes A-Rehu’s Development Manager Milja Heikkinen. \n\n\nMethane is a digestive by-product of fibrous grass feed \n\n\nWhen a cow eats, the microbes in its rumen digest the feed, releasing hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Since hydrogen in large quantities is harmful to the microbes and the cow, the enzymatic activity in the rumen combines the hydrogen and carbon dioxide into methane, which the cow burps as it ruminates.  \n\n\n“Bovaer® prevents the enzyme from working, so no methane is produced. The additive makes it possible to annually reduce about 1,000 kg of CO2-eq per cow. The additive reduces the carbon footprint of milk by about 10–15 percent,” Juha Nousiainen says.  \n\n\nLike carbon dioxide, methane is a greenhouse gas that has a shorter warming effect in the atmosphere, about 10 years, but it is about 28 times more potent.  \n\n\n“A cow burps an average of 400 litres of methane a day. About 18–22 grams of methane per milk kilo is generated, when calculated from calf to adulthood. The methane produced in the rumens of dairy cows accounts for about 2.5 percent of Finland’s greenhouse gases,” Juha Nousiainen notes.  \n\n\n“Over 30 percent of the beef procured by Atria comes from dairy farms. Reducing methane has a clear impact on the carbon footprint of beef and milk. The additive as a whole thus plays a significant role in terms of the environmental impacts of primary production,” says Atria’s Sinikka Hassinen, Director of Beef Procurement. \n\n\nFeed additive can reduce methane emissions by one third \n\n\n“Cattle make it possible for us to produce high-quality food products also in northern fields where grass grows well but food crops don’t always produce sufficient yields. We have significant opportunities to reduce methane. When combining the best-known additive technology, improving cow welfare, and new opportunities provided by animal breeding, the amount of methane per kilo of milk produced can be significantly reduced over the next 15 years,” Juha Nousiainen concludes.  \n\n\nThe feed project in Finland was authorised by the Finnish Food Authority. The safety of the feed’s active ingredient, 3-Nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP), has been studied extensively with animals, consumers, farms and in the environment, with no adverse effects discovered.  \n\n\nFor now, the European Food Safety Authority’s decision on use of the Bovaer® additive applies only to dairy cows. Approval for cattle raised for beef production is expected in the upcoming years, and feed trials are underway in Canada and other countries. \n\n"

        "text": "\n\nThe armed conflict in Ukraine has put all the country's 7,5 million children in serious danger and more than half of them have had to flee their homes. Children and their families are in acute need of help both in Ukraine and in the countries, they have fled to. Valio and the Save the Children Finland are launching a three-year collaboration to help the children and their families who are suffering from the war in Ukraine.\n\n\nThere are almost six million children still in Ukraine who are in immediate danger because of the war. Schools and hospitals are increasingly the target of attacks, bombing has massive destruction in several cities. Already close to two million Ukrainian children have had to flee their native land – and in the worst cases unaccompanied. Children and their families are in danger of being wounded or killed. They also suffer from the lack of basic life necessities, like food, water and healthcare.  \n\n\n“The humanitarian work in Ukraine and in the countries the Ukrainian people are fleeing to must be organised on a wide scale, with sensitivity to the situation and with a professional approach. The aid work must continue for the long term, and its continuity is heavily reliant upon donations. Valio’s three-year commitment to partner with Save the Children Finland and the 250,000 euro donation to help the people suffering from the war in Ukraine is very significant – we are deeply grateful to Valio,” notes \nHanna Markkula-Kivisilta\n, Secretary General of the Save the Children Finland.\n\n\n“The most effective way to be part of the humanitarian operations from Finland is through a monetary donation. The procurement of goods is most cost efficient when done centrally as close to the crisis area as possible. There are also challenges with product donations, for example, strict legislation on baby food can make it difficult to deliver food donations to war and crisis zones. With the monetary donation from Valio, we can help the children and families in the best possible way by organizing most suitable aid to the destinations where it is most needed,” Markkula-Kivisilta adds.\n\n\nValio is helping Ukrainian war victims through a three-year partnership\n\n\nValio wants to do long-term work to help the victims of the war and is donating a total of 250,000 euros over three years to Save the Children Finland.  \n\n\n“We hope that the war in Ukraine will end quickly. However, the Ukrainian people, and especially the children and their families, will need help for a long time. Rebuilding and helping the people will take time, and we have committed to long-term aid for the Ukrainian children. We wanted to partner with an experienced international humanitarian organization because they have the best knowledge and expertise to help the victims of the war in Ukraine,” says Valio’s \nTeresa Laimio\n, Executive Vice President, Sustainability and Stakeholder Relations.\n\n\n“The organisation operates in Ukraine and in the countries the Ukrainian people are fleeing to. Save the Children has already started relief efforts here in Finland to help Ukrainian families with children who have fled from Ukraine,” Teresa Laimio says. \n\n\nSupport of Save the Children reaches families in several countries\n\n\nSave the Children has operated in Ukraine since 2014. The organisation offers life-saving humanitarian aid to children and their families in Ukraine and other countries in the region. The organisation distributes essential items, such as blankets, warm clothing and hygiene kits, provides support to children who have been separated from their parents and coordinates psychosocial support for children traumatised by the war. The organisation enables children to return to school by establishing temporary leaning centres and providing school supplies. The organisation is also ready to support rebuilding of Ukrainian schools and day-care centres as soon as the safety situation allows.\n\n\nSave the Children is also working with children and their parents who have fled to Finland from Ukraine. Save the Children maintains child-friendly spaces at reception centres, giving children who are escaping the war a safe place to play and to be a child. The first child-friendly spaces are already operating, for example there is one in Helsinki’s Länsisatama. Save the Children is prepared to expand its support in Finland with sensitivity to the situation, for example by securing the basic necessities for families.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nFood company Valio and energy company St1 have established a joint venture to produce renewable biogas as transport fuel using dairy farm manure and agricultural by-products. Suomen Lantakaasu Oy is planning the construction of Finland’s so far biggest biogas and liquefaction plant in North Savo. A prerequisite for the biogas production investment is improving the profitability of the entire biogas value chain and particularly more widespread use of a biogas-powered transport fleet.\n\n\nThe joint venture uniquely links the entire value chain – from the network of farmers to biogas production, liquefaction and distribution. Biogas produced from manure creates significant climate benefits and strengthens Finland’s energy and fuel self-sufficiency. \n\n\n“Alongside climate actions, we must secure the continuity of Finnish food production: expenses for farms are at a historic high, and fertiliser, energy and forage costs are continuing to rise. The geopolitical situation is putting the spotlight on energy self-sufficiency. Increasing the production and use of domestic biogas addresses all these challenges,” says \nTeresa Laimio\n, Chair of the Board of Directors of the joint venture, and Valio’s Executive Vice President, Sustainability and Stakeholder Relations.\n\n\nThe St1 and Valio joint venture aims to build 8–10 production plants for biogas production and liquefaction by 2030. The company aims to produce a total of 1 TWh of renewable transport fuel, which corresponds to a quarter of the biogas need for Finland’s roadmap to fossil-free transport. St1 will distribute the biogas through its own nationwide network of fuelling stations for heavy-duty vehicles.\n\n\n“Achieving the target of the roadmap to fossil-free transport requires significant investments in securing the supply of biogas feedstock, subsidising investments, and increasing the use of biogas in transportation. Creating incentives for transport operators to invest in gas-powered fleets is also essential because the target requires 6,000–8,000 biogas-powered trucks on our roads by 2030. The use of biogas in heavy transport can achieve significant emissions reductions, and biogas has a key role also in St1’s own energy transition,” says\n Matti Oksanen\n, Director of St1’s Gas Business. \n\n\nThe planned annual production capacity of the first plant producing liquefied biogas is 125 GWh, and the goal is for it to be operational by 2026. The planned production capacity is exceptionally large. Based on preliminary studies, some 330 farms could participate. The scale also has significant climate impacts. The plant’s annual production is estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 71,000 tonnes a year, and the reductions would target both the transportation and agricultural sectors. The plant entity will reduce the use of fossil diesel by about 11,7 million litres per year, i.e. 117,000 MWh.\n\n\nBiogas reduces also emissions from agriculture and brings direct benefits to farms \n\n\nFarms are geographically dispersed, so efficiently collecting and utilising manure and surplus grass is a challenge at the moment. Suomen Lantakaasu’s innovative hybrid production model will bring this energy production potential into use: the agricultural feedstocks are recirculated at the biogas plant and returned to fields, enabling renewable energy to be recovered and nutrients to be returned to plants. This recycled fertiliser can significantly reduce the use of fossil fuel-based fertilisers, which have become very expensive.\n\n\n“The goal is for a low threshold for farm participation. Utilising manure in biogas production reduces the carbon footprint of milk production by as much as one quarter, when the emissions reduction of both agriculture and transport are taken into account. Valio’s climate programme aims to cut milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035,” says Valio’s \nJuha Nousiainen\n, Senior Vice President, Valio’s Climate Programme.\n\n\nRead more, press release 16.6.2021: Valio and St1 to produce biogas from manure – a new opening in reducing transport emissions\n\n \n\n"

        "text": "\n\nThe certified Valio Carbo® environmental calculator, developed for the Finnish climate and conditions, is used in monitoring the carbon balance of Valio dairy farms. In 2021, already more than thousand dairy farms, i.e. about a quarter of all Valio dairy farms, calculated the carbon footprint of the milk they produce. The calculated average carbon footprint of the milk produced at Valio dairy farms, i.e. raw milk, is 1.06 kilograms CO2e per litre. What makes the calculations significant is the fact that it covers 35 percent of the milk received by Valio and thus already about 28 percent of Finland’s total milk production. The global average carbon footprint of milk is about 2.5 CO2e per litre (FAO (http://www.fao.org/3/CA2929EN/ca2929en.pdf)). \n\n\nThe goal of Valio’s climate programme is to reset the carbon footprint of milk’s value chain to zero by 2035. The biggest emissions reductions can be achieved at dairy farms because about 85-95 percent of all the climate impacts of milk are generated in primary production. Additionally, Valio’s goal is to significantly reduce emissions also in its own production, i.e. in its factories, transports, and packaging.\n\n\nCarbon footprint calculation guides emissions reductions but reveals little about actual climate impacts\n\n\nMore than anything, the carbon footprint is a tool and a means for monitoring success in reducing emissions.\n \nHowever, the figure doesn’t necessarily give a good indication of the climate impacts of individual products.\n\n\nValio Development Manager \nAleksi Astaptsev\n has been developing Valio’s carbon footprint calculation for four years now and has trained 1,800 Valio dairy farmers in the use of the environmental calculator. According to him, the individual carbon footprint figures for food products are, at worst, misleading and meaningless because they tell you nothing without context and information about how the calculation was made. \n\n\n“A carbon footprint calculation can be done in many different ways, and the result depends on the method of calculation. Likewise, the production conditions at farms also impact the carbon footprint of milk. The carbon footprint of the milk transported to Valio’s dairies typically varies between 0.7–1.4 CO2e per litre. We make the calculation at the most accurate level possible and with the actual figures of each farm, rather than using figures based on estimates,” Aleksi Astaptsev explains.\n\n\nIn addition to different methods of calculation, soil impacts, i.e. how much the soil binds or releases carbon, are still missing from the life-cycle assessment of agricultural products. There still isn’t enough research data on how much carbon can be sequestered in mineral soil with year-round grass farming, and how much carbon is emitted from peatland cultivation. The carbon footprint calculation also doesn’t take into account nutritional values. Instead of individual products, the entire meal and its nutrients should be considered. \n\n\n“We don’t eat kilos; we eat nutrients in an effort to get the most balanced nutrition possible. Comparing completely different kinds of products makes no sense because no one eats, say, a kilo of cheese or a kilo of potatoes a day. It’s the totality that matters,” Aleksi Astaptsev says.\n\n\nDairy farmers have good feedback about the calculator \n\n\nThe Valio Carbo® environmental calculator gives dairy farmers an overall picture of the environmental impacts of their own farms: what has a big impact and what doesn’t. The result is comprised of the dairy farm’s activities: the carbon footprint is impacted by the number of arable hectares, the amount of grass farming, the number of cattle, the lifespan and productivity of the cows, the amount of energy and fuel used at the farm, and the forage fed to the cattle. The dairy farmers have provided very good feedback. The calculator is easy to use, and many dairy farmers are pleased when they see that the result is well below expectations.\n\n\n“Finnish consumers are increasingly environmentally aware – which is purely a good thing. It is important to us that we can be part of the solution to the environmental impacts of food production and to produce milk for the products Finns can continue to buy with a good conscience also in the future. We believe that an increasing number of consumers value our work in sustainable food production,” says \nRami Rauhala\n, a dairy farmer from Sievi.\n\n\n“The target for 2021 was to have 500 dairy farms use the calculator. We are pleased that the interest in carbon footprint calculations has been so big that we doubled the target last year. Based on our target, all 4,000 Valio farms will have calculated their milk carbon footprint in 2024,” Aleksi Astaptsev adds.\n\n\nNo offset credits, just genuine actions to reduce own emissions\n\n\nAleksi Astaptsev feels that businesses should take ambitious actions to measure, report, and reduce their own emissions.\n\n\n“Many products carry a label indicating that the product’s carbon emissions have been offset. Offset credits are typically allocated outside the production chain, e.g. to afforestation projects in developing countries. This does not change the actual carbon footprint of the product, and therefore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines, the offset credits should not be included in the carbon footprint, but should be referred to as carbon offsets. Producers should aim first to avoiding the generation of carbon emissions, then to reducing them, and only then to offsetting them,” he sums up.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nStarting at the beginning of 2022, milk is being transported to the Seinäjoki dairy in a new truck that runs on liquefied biogas (LBG). The biogas-powered truck reduces the carbon footprint of milk collection by about 90 percent compared to a diesel-powered truck. Valio aims to annually increase the number of vehicles running on biogas.\n\n\n Valio is targeting a carbon-neutral milk chain by 2035. One of the many ways to achieve the target is to reduce the carbon footprint of transport logistics. Valio’s goal is to annually increase the number of biogas-powered collection vehicles. By 2035, Valio’s fleet will run on renewable fuels like biogas, renewable diesel, hydrogen, or electricity.\n\n\nValio has a total of five biogas-powered trucks collecting milk, four of them run on liquefied biogas produced from household and industrial waste. One truck runs on pressurised manure biogas and refuels at the Vuorenmaa dairy farm in Haapavesi.  The milk collection trucks used by Valio are replaced every 2–3 years, making it possible to quickly change to a more environmentally friendly transport fleet.\n\n\n“All Valio milk and milk collection trucks are on the road nearly 24/7, each driving some 290,000 kilometres a year; this amounts to more than 20 million kilometres for Valio’s entire fleet. That’s why we frequently replace our vehicles and why we always have the latest and most climate friendly technology on the road,” says \nPetteri Laine\n, who as Head of Logistics is responsible for Valio’s milk collection and transports. \n\n\nThe new milk truck is refuelled with liquefied biogas produced from industrial side streams and municipal waste. It collects about 90,000 litres of milk every 24 hours from 40 farms around the Seinäjoki dairy. The intention in the upcoming years is to bring even more biogas-powered vehicles to the Seinäjoki region because the trucks drive to the dairy often and the refuelling station is conveniently located along the routes. Valio has had very good experiences with the usability and reliability of the biogas vehicles. Expanding the biofuel distribution network is critically important to expanding the fleet.\n\n\n“Even though transports account for about 1.5% of the carbon footprint of the milk produced by Valio, reducing the fossil-based emissions of logistics is important for the carbon-neutral milk chain goal because collecting milk from some 4,000 dairy farms and delivering it to 12 dairies – in addition to transporting the many Valio products around Finland – adds up to a lot of kilometres on the road,” says Petteri Laine.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland are together launching a project to research what kinds of food industry raw materials could be produced using cellular agriculture. The research project will develop technology for biotechnologically produced proteins. In cellular agriculture, food is produced in bioreactors with microbes. Valio is familiar with the fermentation process, as it is traditionally used in the production of fermented milk products and cheeses.\n\n\nHalf of the world’s fertile land is currently used for agriculture. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) predicts that there is only 60 years of fertile topsoil left if we do not make current farming practices more sustainable and efficient. At the same time, the UN predicts the world population to grow to 9.8 billion by 2050, according to 2015 population prospects. Globally, the demand for food will double, and it must be produced with half the current emissions. \n\n\n“We also need new food production methods alongside sustainable, traditional agriculture. A key question is how to produce more food for the globally growing population without needing more arable land. Alongside traditional food production, cellular agriculture is one of the possible solutions to feeding the growing population. We are currently studying what kinds of food industry raw materials could be produced with microbes,” says\n Harri Kallioinen, \nSenior Vice President, Research & Development at Valio. \n\n\nThe new joint project by Valio and VTT will develop technology for biotechnologically produced proteins. In the method, the producer organism, e.g. a fungus, is instructed to produce the desired protein. To live in the fermentation tank, the fungus uses sugar and other nutrients, and secretes protein into the growth medium. There are many interesting opportunities in cellular agriculture that also Valio wants to explore. \n\n\n“Cellular agriculture makes it possible to produce a variety of raw materials and end products, from purified proteins or fats to multidimensional cell structures,” notes Research Manager \nEmilia Nordlund \nfrom VTT. \n\n\nThere are still many unsolved challenges with cellular agriculture\n\n\n“Animal-based products like milk or meat are complex. They are made up of many different compounds and structures that are very difficult to fully replicate in their entirety. Cellular agriculture is best suited for the production of individual raw material components. That’s why we see that both have a place in future food production. To meet the increasing food needs of the growing population, all possible food production methods are needed and they must become more sustainable. There are also certain cellular agriculture challenges that we have to solve. For example, a lot of low-cost and low-carbon energy is needed in order for the large-scale production of proteins in fermentation tanks to be feasible. This is what we are working on with\n Hanna Tuomisto,\n Associate Professor of sustainable food systems at University of Helsinki, and her research team,” Kallioinen continues. \n\n\nCellular agriculture may sound like science fiction, but it has a long history. Products made using the same technique have been around for a long time. \n\n\n“Examples include Quorn, which has been sold in stores for decades and produced from fungus biomass, microalgae sold as nutritional supplements, and enzymes widely used in food products – like lactase used in making lactose-free milk products and rennet used to precipitate milk protein into cheese. Pekilo, an animal feed developed in Finland back in the 1970s, was also cellular agricultural product,” says Valio Technology Manager \nNiina Valkonen\n. \n\n"

Health-conscious people want to avoid e-codes or ingredients they don’t recognise. Products made from familiar, understandable ingredients and with minimal processing meet consumer expectations for clean-label products. Transparent and sustainable production chains are also of interest to consumers,” says \nTimo Pajari\n, SVP Food Solution Sales, Valio.\n\n\n“Sustainability also means healthy and safe nutrition for people. We call this better-for-you thinking. We make and supply food ingredients that enable sugar and salt reduction, protein enrichment, clean-label and gut health. In other words, better nutrition,” continues Timo Pajari.\n\n\nValio’s patented lactose-free technology provides new business opportunities for digestive wellness \n\n\nDigestive wellness has gained interest among consumers globally and it will continue to grow. In general, the growing interest in gut-friendly functional claims and ingredients has been boosted by the pandemic. For example, the retail value of lactose-free dairy is growing by 8% annually in Western Europe. In areas like the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia, the growth rate exceeds the average. \n\n\nValio will be offering a webinar “Digestive wellness is driving lactose-free growth” and a live Q&A \non Tuesday, November 30, 2021, at 3:30 p.m. \nwithin the Exhibitor Showcases agenda. You will hear why digestive wellness is a major business opportunity, and how to build a profitable business in dairy, beverage, and other categories.\n\n\n“Lactose-free can be a great opportunity for profitability improvement when consumers associate the products with digestive benefits. Lactose-free dairy may not be mainstream yet, so now is the time to act. The key to success is making food and beverages with a superior taste and nutritional benefits that consumers can enjoy,” emphasises Timo Pajari.\n\n\nHow to make low-sugar and high-protein products taste great\n\n\nConsumers are increasingly conscious of the sugar content in products and looking for low-sugar options without artificial add-ons. With Valio’s solutions you can reduce sugar levels in a way that does not compromise other important product qualities, like texture or taste. You can also meet the trend of high-protein and nutritious food products by adding the benefits of high-quality milk protein to your product portfolio. The high protein content of Valio Eila® milk powders makes them perfect for healthy ageing or sport nutrition products, for dietary products, and for other products requiring an increased level of high-quality protein. \n\n\n“The most successful concepts pick a few consumer benefits and connect them to multiple big trends. For example, a protein pudding that builds on the trend of protein-enriched products and then combines it with digestive wellness. The product is also lactose-free, but this is not the unique selling point,” Timo Pajari summarizes.\n\n\nRead more about business opportunities \n\n"

        "text": "\n\nAn increasing number of Valio’s products are packaged in renewable-based solutions, such as packaging board. Currently, 72 percent of all Valio packaging materials used in Finland are made from renewable materials. The latest packaging board can now be found on the yoghurt shelf: this autumn’s newest yoghurts, Valio Luonnonjogurtti+™ baked apple and Valio Luonnonjogurtti+™ mango & peach are packaged in board-based cups. Valio’s goal is to gradually shift to board-based packaging as much as possible.\n\n\nEnvironmentally smart packaging minimises climate impacts, is made from renewable or recycled materials, and is fully recyclable. This kind of product packaging will increase every year. Already 72 percent of the Valio’s single-use packaging materials in Finland are made from renewable materials. For example, gable-top milk, yoghurt, sour milk, and cream cartons – and their caps – are made from plant-based, renewable material.\n \nValio annually packages more than 250 million units this way.\n\n\n“More and more often, Valio’s packaging is being produced from renewable materials that are easy to recycle – and increasingly from recycled materials as well. We are replacing fossil-based plastics with renewable, plant-based solutions and recycled materials, such as recycled plastics and board. Our goal is that eventually all our product packaging is made from plant-based or recycled materials and is one hundred percent recyclable,” says \nJuhana Pilkama\n, Valio’s Head of Packaging Development.\n\n\nThe new board-based yoghurt cups are a good example of environmentally smart packaging. By using a board-based solution instead of plastic for the yoghurt cups, Valio is reducing plastic use by 67 percent. The new yogurt cups can now be recycled easily in the cardboard recycling bin.\n\n\nNew life for recycled packaging\n\n\nPlastic is still necessary when packaging food products, and it can’t be completely replaced. All board-based packaging has a thin plastic film to ensure that a liquid product doesn’t leak or spoil.\n\n\n“Packaging is designed to protect the product from spoiling. When recycled properly, also plastic packaging is a good thing. Plastic also can be manufactured from plant-based materials or from recycled plastic materials. When plastic packaging is recycled, it can be turned into other products, like cleaning tools or decking boards made from recycled plastic. Recycled plastic already accounts for more than 50% of Valio’s sliced cheese packaging. That’s why it’s very important to recycle all recyclable material.” \n\n\nRecyclable materials are valuable yet are often thrown into mixed waste when they could still be recovered for reuse. \n\n\n“For example, the aluminium lid on a yoghurt cup seems like such a minor thing, but it should be recycled because there’s a demand for aluminium as a raw material – and it’s so easy to recycle it in the metal recycling bin,” notes Juhana Pilkama.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nFinnish dairy and food company Valio and DKSH have signed an agreement on the distribution of special milk powders to Valio’s industrial customers in the Asian market. With the new partnership, Valio is pursuing growth for its dairy-based ingredients, which are ideal for special nutrition such as nutrition for the elderly people or athletes. Valio and DKSH see a lot of collaboration potential in the market for various gut-friendly, value-added, and wellness products.\n\n\nThe global health and wellness trend is driving the growing demand for milk-based products in Asia. Consumers are interested in healthy and natural products that support wellbeing and have high nutritional value. Milk protein is scientifically proven to be the most nutritious of natural protein sources. Valio has conducted scientific research on the properties of milk for more than 100 years.\n\n\nThe majority of the population in South-East Asia is not able to enjoy dairy products because of the lactose in milk. Valio has always been interested in people’s health and wellbeing and has strived to develop science- and research-based products that promote wellness.\n\n\n“Industry-tailored, lactose-free Valio Eila® products are an example of our pioneering and research-based product development. Thanks to our unique technology, they are gut-friendly and can be enjoyed also by people who typically can’t consume milk products. We help local food industry companies to develop products for their own customers, products like protein-rich yoghurts and low-sugar chocolate, that meet local nutritional needs and are gut friendly,” says \nTimo Pajari\n, Senior Vice President heading Valio’s international sales of special milk powders.\n\n\nLifelong wellbeing from dairy-based products\n\n\nProper nutrition is the foundation of wellbeing at all stages of life. In the first stages, we need food that is wholesome and safe for babies and children. As adults, we might need protein-rich food to support an active lifestyle or food that is low in calories to help with weigh management; and as we age, we need food that is tasty and nutritious.\n\n\n“Valio’s special milk powders can be used to add protein to snacks for athletes, for example, or to lower the sugar content in chocolate without compromising taste and quality. With our diverse range of products and our leading expertise, we can help food industry companies to introduce completely new products that meet people’s changing needs,” Timo Pajari explains. \n\n\nValio, a Finnish dairy and food company owned by 4,300 dairy farmers, has operated in the South-East Asian market for years. Valio is especially known for its high-quality, safe, and pure dairy products. Thanks to the clean Arctic environment, meticulous quality control, extremely high level of hygiene, animal welfare, and responsible milk production, Valio’s milk is among the purest in the world.\n\n\n“It was natural for us to partner with DKSH because they have a strong foothold in Asia and long-term expertise in the food and beverage segment. With our products, they also have the ability to help their customers to develop new kinds of products for new target groups and thus to grow their market share in new segments. As a result of this collaboration, Valio’s special milk powders are now available in Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Singapore,” Timo Pajari says.\n\n\n“We are very pleased to enter a distribution agreement with Valio in several key markets across South-East Asia and Taiwan. Valio is a brand leader in Finland and major player in the international dairy ingredients market with over 115 years of experience and Nobel prize-winning innovation. The company’s high-quality milk powders, from fresh Finnish milk that is pure and clean combined with modern technology, are an excellent fit for our product portfolio in several applications such as Confectionery & Bakery, Dairy and Ready meals. The products will be advantageous to our large customer base in Asia due to their protein content, taste and other benefits. We look forward to increasing our market coverage with Valio in the region,” says \nCesar Saez\n, Vice President Global Food & Beverage Ingredients, DKSH.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio, Atria, and Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) are working together to create a national model to calculate the carbon footprint of cattle farms. The model is based on Valio’s previously developed Lypsikki LCA modelling*, which can be used to verify the differences between production farms and the impacts that measures implemented at the farm level have on the milk carbon footprint. The end result of the collaboration will be a national calculation model that takes into consideration the special characteristics of Finnish production in calculating the carbon footprint of milk and beef production. Atria’s goal is to introduce a product-specific carbon footprint label on consumer packages of beef.\n\n\nClimate change is the biggest global challenge of our time and has broad implications also for Finland and the Finnish people. Through our own actions, however, we can reduce food production emissions. Atria, Valio, and Luke are now working together on the development of a globally unique calculation model for milk and beef production. \n\n\n“Comparable carbon footprint calculations are needed to verify and guide emission reductions in food production. But even more important than individual figures are the concrete actions that slow climate change and adequately accelerate the reduction in emissions,” notes \nAleksi Astaptsev\n, the Valio scientist who has developed the carbon footprint calculation.\n\n\n“There are many different carbon footprint calculation models used around the world, but none of them take into consideration the special characteristics related to Finnish milk and beef production. We are now bringing together Valio’s long-term efforts in carbon footprint calculation development, Luke’s scientific research, and Atria’s strong vision of carbon-neutral beef production,” says \nSinikka Hassinen\n Director of Beef Procurement at Atria. \n\n\nThe Lypsikki LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) calculation model developed by Valio uses the most accurate calculation methods available, and it is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) formulas. The calculation includes all variables, such as fertilisers used in farming, the number of cattle, the size of the arable land, and the fuel used at the farm. Based on the calculation model, Valio has developed for its own dairy farms the CARBO® environmental calculator, which has Carbon Trust certification. By further developing the calculation model, also the actual climate impacts of beef production can be measured – in addition to greenhouse emissions from milk production.\n\n\n“A farm-specific calculator makes it possible to measure the carbon balance efficiently and reliably; using those measurements, the correct actions that reduce environmental impacts can be implemented at the farm level. Changes might be related to how the cows are fed, how the fields are conditioned, how the crops are cultivated, or how the manure is handled. Valio’s goal is to cut milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035,” says, Aleksi Astaptsev. \n\n\n“This cooperation brings together the research and food chain insights gained about Finnish milk and beef production processes over a couple of decades to form the calculation models. With these models, it’s possible to model the climate impacts of production,” notes \nAnu Kaukovirta\n, Vice President, Production Systems at Luke.  \n\n\n“The models are never complete, but it is really inspiring that constantly evolving research knowledge enables them to be further developed and enhanced. Luke is researching the topic very intensively at the Jokioinen, Maaninka and Ruukki research sites, and the aim is to feed the information that those sites produce into the models as quickly as possible to support the entire food chain’s climate work,” Kaukovirta continues. \n\n\nFarm-specific carbon footprint calculation helps cattle farms to accurately target climate actions\n\n\nSince autumn 2020, dairy farms have been able to use the Valio-developed CARBO® environmental calculator to calculate their own climate impacts and to determine the most effective measures to reduce them. So far, nearly 700 Valio dairy farms have calculated the carbon footprint of the milk they produce.\n\n\nAtria has more than 1,200 contract farms that are specialised in beef production. In 2022 Atria will create a calculator for these farms that will help the producers make their production more sustainable – both financially and environmentally. \n\n\n“Atria’s goal is to introduce a product-specific carbon footprint label for consumer packages of beef. Finnish consumers are increasingly conscious of the environmental impacts of food, and a carbon footprint label is one way to serve consumers even better,” says Sinikka Hassinen. \n\n\n*The Lypsikki LCA model is based on the Lypsikki dairy farm model developed in 2006-2018 by \nJuha Nousiainen\n, Senior Vice President, Carbon-neutral Milk Chain at Valio, and Professor \nPekka Huhtanen \n(MTT/SLU/Luke). ProAgria applied it as the basis for its CowCompass tool in 2010, so the model is widely used in dairy farm production planning.\n\n"

With the transaction, Valio becomes an even more comprehensive partner for food industry professionals.\n\n\n“We are really pleased with the FCCA’s decision. Going forward, we will be a more comprehensive partner to those food industry professionals for whom quality, a deep understanding of customer needs, and delivery reliability are key factors. Heinon Tukku is a traditional family-owned company, and Valio is owned by Finnish dairy farmers. We share a similar set of values,” says Valio’s \nTuomas Sorri\n, who will head the new business unit created through the transaction. \n\n\nThe FCCA investigated the competition impacts of the Valio and Heinon Tukku transaction. The transaction involves the merger of a manufacturer and a wholesaler. Based on the FCCA’s investigation, the merger will not lead to the market exclusion of Valio’s or Heinon Tukku’s competitors. A condition of the merger approval is that Valio must commit to protecting the sensitive information of competitors it receives as a result of the transaction so that it isn’t transmitted in the organisation in a manner that is detrimental to competition\n\n\n“It is common that the implementation of a business merger is subject to certain conditions. We will act in the manner required by the FCCA’s decision,” notes Sorri.\n\n\nPetri Heino\n, CEO of Tukkuheino Oy, shares his sentiments: \n\n\n“I especially want to thank all Heinon Tukku employees and partners for the good collaboration, which in many cases has spanned multiple decades. Heinon Tukku has terrific employees, and through our shared years we have had so many great encounters with customers and other stakeholders. It is with bittersweetness but complete confidence that we now hand Heinon Tukku’s reins over to Valio.” \n\n\n“Our family-owned company has three centuries of experience in the food industry, and we will remain in the food and beverage business. Our 120-year story will now live on in a new format. Heinon Tukku has been our group’s biggest, most prominent, and most well-known company, but we are retaining our ownership of Kalavapriikki, Uniq Drinks Finland, and Anton & Anton. Going forward, we want to put more focus on the development of these companies,” adds Heino. \n\n\nGrowth in eating out is a factor \n\n\nThe backdrop of the transaction is the eating out and takeaway trend, which is expected to return to growth after the coronavirus pandemic eases. \n\n\nIn the future, Valio will be a single-source supplier of everything a professional kitchen needs: in addition to an extensive selection of raw materials, support in product development and in creating meal and snack concepts. \n\n\nHeinon Tukku has a portfolio of thousands of products – from fresh vegetables to napkins – and its customers are restaurants and coffee shops particularly in the Helsinki metropolitan area. Valio has the country’s most extensive distribution network and particularly public sector customers. \n\n\nRead more: \nValio to acquire Heinon Tukku Oy ─ eating away from home is a long-term megatrend,\n Valio press release 27.4.2021\n\n\nStock photos:\n\n\nImages for media use\n \n\n\nHeinon Tukku’s image bank\n \n\n\n\n \n\n"

        "text": "\n\nFood company Valio and energy company St1 are establishing a joint venture to produce renewable biogas from dairy farm manure and other agricultural by-products mainly as fuel for heavy-duty transport. The company to be established is targeting up to 1,000 GWh (1 terawatt-hour) of biogas production by 2030; this amount is one third of the biogas needed for Finland’s fossil-free transport roadmap. Significant emissions reductions can be achieved by using biogas for heavy-duty transport. However, the prerequisite for creating a supply and demand that aligns with Finland’s biogas target is that the biogas-powered transport fleet becomes significantly more common in Finland.\n\n\nThe joint venture will produce biogas mainly from cow manure, although other agricultural and food industry by-products can also be used. \n\n\nThere are two different alternatives for producing the biogas: one alternative is that the biogas will be produced at individual farms or at a few farms in a shared biogas plant. The other alternative is that the biogas will be produced in a larger biogas plant to which the manure would be transported from local farms. Both the alternatives are possible in Valio and St1’s joint project. Valio and St1 have estimated that in phase one, around the middle of the decade, the biogas would be produced at 2-3 concentrations.\n\n\nThe partners are aiming for production capacity of up to one terawatt-hour by 2030, assuming there is enough growth in the demand for biogas in transportation. This is a significant investment package, the detailed planning of which will begin now. \n\n\nSt1 will distribute the joint venture’s biogas mainly through its nationwide network of fuelling stations for heavy-duty vehicles. Valio and St1 intend to transition to the increased use of manure biogas also in their own logistics.\n\n\n“We have identified strategic focus areas, where we can best achieve our goal in creating a sustainable carbon cycle. By investing in renewable energy and in the transition of the energy sector while ensuring the necessary cash flow, we are solving global energy challenges. Entering the biogas business is a concrete step in the consistent and long-term implementation of our growth strategy.  Domestic manure biogas can reduce the emissions from heavy-duty transport quickly and efficiently while simultaneously improving Finland’s fuel self sufficiency. This is an opening from two Finnish players in bringing domestic manure biogas to the markets,” says St1 Oy’s CEO \nMika Wiljanen.\n\n\nSt1 communicated earlier this spring about the start of biogas business also in Sweden and Norway. \n\n\nAgricultural emissions will also decrease\n\n\nMaking biogas from manure decreases the methane emissions from the biological decomposition of manure. At best, milk’s carbon footprint will decrease by one quarter, when both agricultural and transport emissions reductions are taken into account.\n\n\n“Valio aims to cut milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. The use of manure as a transport fuel is one of the most important handprint actions in our climate programme. The intention is that dairy farms can take part in the biogas production with a low threshold. It’s clear that production must be a profitable business also from the dairy farms’ perspective,” says Valio’s CEO \nAnnikka Hurme\n.\n\n\nAdded bonus: recycled fertilisers, bedding for animals, and substrates for vegetables\n\n\nThe material left over from biogas production can be used to make many valuable circular economy products. \n\n\n“Liquids and dry materials left over from biogas production can be used as recycled fertilisers for fields, reducing the use of chemical fertilisers and nutrient run-off to waterways. The farmer saves money. The left over material can also be used to make bedding for animals or substrates for vegetables. This can replace the peat that is currently used,” says \nJuha Nousiainen\n, Senior Vice President, Carbon-neutral Milk Chain.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio Group net sales in 2020 were EUR 1,808 million (2019: EUR 1,787 million), up 1.2% on the previous year. Domestic net sales decreased by 0.9 percent, and international net sales rose 4.3 percent. The coronavirus pandemic affected domestic consumption and was visible in the growth in retail sales and the decrease in HoReCa sales. However, in the challenging year Valio was able to slightly improve the milk return*.\n\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic affected our operations in all markets. People stayed at home and cooked for themselves, boosting retail sales. Eating in restaurants and staff canteens fell away, so hotel, restaurant and catering (HoReCa) sales decreased. \n\n\nRetail sales grew in Finland  \n\n\n“Despite the coronavirus pandemic, Valio recorded a good financial performance and the milk return continued to grow. I am especially proud of the fact that, in spite of the challenging year, we were able to secure our employees’ health and wellbeing, and we were able to maintain normal production and excellent delivery reliability. One of our strengths is flexible production capacity, so we were able to shift production quickly from large package sizes designed for restaurants to consumer packages. Additionally, demand in our export markets grew, despite the pandemic,” says Valio’s CEO\n Annikka Hurme\n.  \n\n\nThe impacts of the pandemic were clearly visible in domestic consumption, as it shifted from eating in restaurants to home cooking. Consumer buying power weakened in the course of the coronavirus pandemic, so we launched more items under the Valio Hyvä suomalainen Arki® brand. \n\n\nThe market for plant-based products also continued to grow. Valio Oddlygood® Barista became a favourite with consumers in Finland.  During the year Valio launched Valio Oddlygood® Veggie grated, which is used like cheese. \n\n\nChina accelerated international sales growth \n\n\nNet sales from international operations totalled EUR 746 million (EUR 715 million). The growth was strongest in China, where demand recovered quickly after the coronavirus shock in early 2020, and net sales increased by more than 40 percent on the previous year. \n\n\n“Despite the growth, Valio is a small actor in China. Our most important task is to further improve the profitability of exports and to build recognition of our products and brand,” Hurme says.\n\n\nGrowth in net sales in the nearby markets of Sweden, Estonia, and Russia was moderate. In the US, the pandemic caused steep price fluctuations, which weakened financial performance, but net sales remained at a reasonably level. After a slump early in the year, the global market price of milk powders began to rise towards the end of the year. \n\n\nValio pays all its profits to its owners \n\n\nValio is owned by 4,300 Finnish milk producers, and Valio pays its operating profit to the dairy farms through the co-operatives. Valio’s financial success is measured with a milk margin* and a milk return**.\n\n\nThe milk margin amounted to EUR 861 million (EUR 838 million), and the milk return was 41.5 cents per litre (41.2 c/l).\n\n\nValio’s Board of Directors, which is comprised of milk producers, determines the raw milk price based on the market situation and Valio’s financial standing. In 2020, the average price Valio paid for milk was 40.9 cents per litre (39.9 c/l). The price included after payments of 1.5 cents per litre paid to the co-operatives. The sustainability bonus to encourage the continuous improvement of animal welfare remained at two cents per litre.\n\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Valio has been able to pay Finnish milk producers a higher price for milk than the European average. \n\n\nValio updated its strategy\n\n\nValio’s strategy was updated in 2020. In its operations, Valio will focus on four areas to pursue future growth. \n\n\n“Business operations focusing on milk in the domestic market continue to be the strongest of these, and we will continue its further development. Raw materials and solutions that generate added value especially for our industrial customers is an important new focus area, whereby we are seeking growth globally, for example in Asia. We also see potential for growth in plant-based products, where we are further developing our offering as well as looking to export markets. In addition, we are continuously evaluating various new business opportunities and new partnerships,” notes Annikka Hurme.\n\n\nValio is part of the climate change solution \n\n\nValio continued the ambitious climate work in 2020. Our goal is to cut the carbon footprint of the entire milk chain – from farm to grocery store – to zero by 2035. \n\n\nValio set Science Based Targets on climate in 2020. According to the targets, greenhouse gas emissions from milk production per litre of raw milk taken in will be halved by 2030, compared with 2019.  \n\n\nValio continued training dairy farmers in carbon farming. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Valio invested in an electronic learning platform, in collaboration with the environmental foundation Baltic Sea Action Group. The platform went live in early 2021. \n\n\nIn October Valio launched an environmental calculator for all Valio dairy farms, enabling them to calculate the carbon footprint of the milk produced at their farm. Valio also initiated training in the use of the calculator. \n\n\nValio continued studies on using cattle manure in biogas production to reduce climate impacts. The first milk truck using biogas produced at a farm commenced milk collection at the beginning of 2021. \n\n\nIn late 2020 a biogas station was opened at the Vuorenmaa dairy farm in Haapavesi; vehicles can fill up with biogas made from cow manure. There is enough to supply the milk truck as well as other gas-powered vehicles, and it can be purchased from a normal gas pump. Biogas will have an important role in the future as a reducer of transportation emissions because it will replace fossil fuels, i.e. diesel and gasoline. At the same time, the dairy farm’s carbon footprint is significantly decreased. \n\n\nValio started a three-year project together with the Natural Resources Institute Finland, which will focus on studying cultivation methods that reduce emissions from peatlands. In addition, ten measurement chambers were installed at four Valio dairy farms to measure soil carbon balance. \n\n\nAs of the beginning of 2021, all 4,300 dairy farms meet Valio’s sustainability criteria for animal well-being and receive a sustainability bonus for their work. The requirements include, for example, preventive health care for the cows and systematic monitoring of their welfare. \n\n\nImproving efficiency continued in 2020 \n\n\nValio’s goals in 2020 were to increase net sales and improve profitability. The three-year programme introduced in 2018 to improve cost efficiency, profitability, and competitiveness proceeded well and will continue to the end of 2021. The coronavirus pandemic raised costs, and some project implementations had to be postponed. The pandemic also meant that some jobs were temporarily discontinued, and we conducted cooperation negotiations in spring 2020, which resulted in lay-offs in head office functions.\n\n\nContract production secures future milk production\n\n\nValio and the milk procurement co-operatives switched to contract production at the beginning of 2021. Contract production means that the milk procurement co-operatives supply a pre-agreed volume of raw milk to Valio. The goal is to secure the future of dairy farms in both the medium and long term and to maximise the price paid for raw milk to the co-operatives and, consequently, to the dairy farmers. Better predictability of the total milk volume is necessary so that Valio can adjust its production capacity to market demand.\n\n\nContract production secures the sufficiency of powder manufacturing capacity, and in 2020 sales of value-added powders grew by 10 percent. The use of value-added powders enables, for instance, a chocolate manufacturer to reduce a product’s sugar content without changing the taste, or the powders offer some other advantage for customers. In Finland, a new packaging plant for consumer powders was built in Lapinlahti, and the Seinäjoki powder drying tower’s production capacity was increased. These investments are preparing Valio to grow its exports of value-added powders. \n\n\nYear 2021 \n\n\nThe first half of 2021 started with a continuation of the coronavirus pandemic. Looking after the health of our personnel and dairy farmers and keeping production going remain our priorities. \n\n\nIn line with strategic focus areas, Valio will continue to invest in new growth, operational efficiency, and improved profitability in 2021. As a result of contract production, there has been a moderate decrease in raw milk volumes since the beginning of the year. \n\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic continues to make operations difficult for our restaurant, hotel and industrial kitchen customers. On the other hand, retail demand is on a good level. The market situation for butter and milk powders seems positive globally, and we see growth potential especially in the value-added powder business in China and elsewhere in Asia, for example. \n\n\n“A key issue regarding product exports, as well as importing ingredients and supplies, is whether international borders will remain open. Valio’s strength is that milk, the most important ingredient of our products manufactured in Finland, is produced locally, at Valio owners’ dairy farms.

As a result, confectionery manufacturers are looking for ways to reduce sugar while maintaining the naturality of their products. With Valio’s solution, sugar reduction is achieved with dairy ingredients without any artificial sweeteners.\n\n\nEU regulations concerning unhealthy foods are expected to increase and tighten in the coming years. The EU’s European Green Deal plan includes a Farm to Fork Strategy that impacts the production of food. Its aim is to make food systems fair, healthy, and environmentally friendly.\n\n\n“The Farm to Fork Strategy is expected to have many effects on the sales and consumption of unhealthy foods. The planned initiatives would urge product reformulation and restrict the promotion and marketing of food products that are high in sugar, salt, and/or fat,” says \nSinikka Saikkonen\n, Business Development Manager at Valio.\n\n\nThe planned measures deeply impact the market of indulgence foods, as they often contain high amounts of sugar, salt, and fat. Those confectionery manufacturers who can find ways to develop products with better nutritional value, will gain a competitive edge in the changing operational environment.\n\n\nConsumers crave for better-for-you indulgence products\n\n\nConsumers are becoming increasingly aware of the health effects of food. They read labels carefully and often go for the better-for-you choice whenever one is available. Consumer demand for better-for-you products extends to the indulgence category, as well. \n\n\n“People are looking for green light for indulgence. They want to trade their regular indulgent foods for products that have less of the bad things and more of the good things. The key to successful better-for-you products is to replace a part of the ingredients healthier, sustainably sourced, and more natural alternatives,” explains Saikkonen.\n\n\nPermissible indulgence with one solution – meet Valio at World Confectionery Conference\n\n\n“Consumers want guilt free indulgence. Yet, they are not willing to sacrifice on the taste or texture of chocolate and confectionery. Valio has the solutions and milk-based ingredients to help develop desirable and delicious confectionery for health-aware consumers. Food manufacturers can make chocolate and confectionery with reduced sugar, high protein, and digestive wellness,” says \nTimo Pajari\n, Senior Vice President, Valio Food Solutions Sales and Marketing.\n\n\n“Claims on limited sugar or no added sugar are preferred by consumers, and the prevalence of sugar claims is likely to grow as manufacturers aim to reassure consumers and differentiate themselves. Using artificial sweeteners is no longer an option, as consumers want their chocolate and confectionery to be as clean label as possible. Naturality is something that consumers are looking for in their indulgence products. Valio’s specialty milk powders help confectionery manufacturers to develop new better-for-you products for consumer who expect more than just normal,” Pajari continues.\n\n\nValio experts are introducing the solution at the virtual World Confectionery Conference 2021 on 1st June.

Valio’s aim is to be a more comprehensive partner to restaurant and coffee shop professionals. That is why it is acquiring Heinon Tukku Oy. In the future, Valio will be a single-source supplier of everything a professional kitchen needs: in addition to an extensive selection of raw materials, support in product development and in creating meal and snack concepts. The transaction is subject to approval by the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority.\n\n\n“People’s habits are changing as the world changes – including where and how we eat. We grab a snack on the go, we eat or have coffee away from home, and we pick up a chef-made meal to bring home. The coronavirus temporarily forced customers out of restaurants, but once we beat the pandemic people will again go out to meet up with friends around good food. Professional kitchens have been Valio’s customers for decades. We want to be an even better partner for them in the future,” explains Valio CEO \nAnnikka Hurme\n.  \n\n\nHeinon Tukku Oy has been in business for over 120 years and is today one of Finland’s biggest wholesalers serving professional kitchens. Heinon Tukku’s typical turnover in recent years has been around 240 million euros. The coronavirus pandemic naturally reduced its turnover, which was about 170 million euros in 2020. About 340 employees will transfer to Valio through the acquisition. The acquisition will create for Valio a new business unit, which will be headed by \nTuomas Sorri\n. Sorri is currently Senior Vice President of Valio Food Solutions, which serves professional kitchens and the food industry. Valio Executive Board member \nElli Siltala \nwill have the overall responsibility of the business unit.\n\n\n“Valio and Heinon Tukku genuinely complement each other. Heinon Tukku has a portfolio of thousands of products – from fresh vegetables to napkins – and its customers are restaurants and coffee shops particularly in the Helsinki metropolitan area. Valio brings the country’s most extensive distribution network and particularly public sector customers. We deliver orders on time directly to restaurants, coffee shops, filling stations, and employee restaurants from Hanko to Utsjoki. Together we will be a more comprehensive partner to those restaurant industry players for whom quality, Finnish origin, a deep understanding of customer needs, and delivery reliability are key factors,” notes Sorri.\n\n\n“Valio will be a good owner for Heinon Tukku. The strengths of the parties in this acquisition complement each other, and there aren’t many overlapping functions. Valio is a valued and responsible Finnish player and a familiar company; we have collaborated with Valio for more than 100 years,” notes \nPetri Heino\n, CEO of Tukkuheino Oy, the parent company of Heinon Tukku.\n\n\n“Acquiring Heinon Tukku is a natural step that aligns with our strategy.  Our goal is to be a frontrunner in food sector solutions, and Heinon Tukku’s know-how and broad product portfolio will bring a significant addition to this. We also share a similar set of values.

        "text": "\n\nIn 2020, Valio set science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and now, they have been accepted by the Science Based Targets initiative.* Valio is committed to limit the environmental impact of its production chain to an increase of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement. Dairy farm greenhouse emissions are monitored with the CARBO® environmental calculator. Over 600 dairy farms have already calculated their carbon footprint as a base for emissions reductions in the future.\n\n\nSet in summer 2020, Valio’s emission reduction targets to stop global warming at 1.5 degrees have been certified by the Science Based Targets initiative. These are significant reductions in all Valio’s production chain, from the dairy farm to the store shelves: the emission reduction target for milk is 50% on the farm level, 47% on the plant level, and 28% on the milk collection logistics level, by 2030 compared to the levels in 2019. However, Valio’s climate targets reach further than that: Valio is aiming to reduce emissions for a net zero carbon footprint for milk by the year 2035. \n\n\n“When we talk about resetting the carbon footprint of Valio’s entire operation and value chain, it is inevitable to assess our environmental work through an external, trustworthy party in a credible, transparent and science-based manner”, says \nJuha Nousiainen\n, Valio SVP, Carbon neutral milk chain. \n\n\nThere are many things that affect milk’s carbon footprint. The volume of climate emissions varies a lot between farms, depending on the energy used at the farm, the age of their herd, feeding and productivity, the plants and yields of their fields, and the ways the farm’s manure is processed. Additionally, milk refining, packaging, and logistics add another 10-15%. Valio is reaching for reduced emissions throughout the entire production chain.\n\n\n“85-90 percent of milk and dairy products’ environmental impact is generated in primary production, before the milk is brought to a dairy. It is, however, important that the industrial and logistics emissions are monitored and reduced in various ways. In accordance with our targets, we are aiming to cut milk’s environmental impact in half by 2030. With such a challenge, we must understand what generates carbon emissions and what are the profitable ways to reduce them”, says Juha Nousiainen. \n\n\nCarbon footprint calculations help dairy farms reduce emissions and save money\n\n\nValio’s farm-specific carbon balance monitoring uses the CARBO® environmental calculator, which was developed with Finland’s climate and conditions in mind. It can help dairy farms calculate their own environmental impact and figure out the most effective ways to reduce them. \n\n\n“Actions that reduce emissions, such as carbon farming, higher grass harvest, animal wellbeing, and improving feed use also improve the farms’ productivity and profitability. Productivity and climate efficiency are not at conflict with each other, and it can also be a motivator for dairy farmers”, says Juha Nousiainen.\n\n\nKosti Kopola\n, who runs the KoposWarm dairy farm at Haapajärvi, calculated their farm’s carbon footprint for the first time in late 2020. The farm has 130 cows, and a total of 230 hectares of fields. Their fields are, generally, used for year-round grass cultivation. The first results were very positive: the farm’s carbon footprint was equivalent to 0.89 kg of CO2 per litre of milk**. Kopola paid note to fuel consumption, which he thinks could be smaller.  \n\n\n“The farm’s field blocks are far enough from each other that it’s inevitable we have to drive the machines around. Planning our work and how we drive matter, obviously. We have been replanning our land in a way to get the fields closer to the farm buildings. That could have a significant effect on fuel use”, thinks Kosti Kopola.\n\n\nKopola is pleased with how easy the calculator is to use, as well as with how following the farm’s emissions can let him make the necessary changes to reach the 2035 target. Such changes could be optimisations to animal feeding, improving the fields’ condition and improving the harvest, as well as manure processing methods. These are actions that don’t just lower greenhouse emissions, they also save money and improve the farm economy.  \n\n\nThe IPCC’s most accurate calculation guidelines, which Valio uses, includes all factors from the fertiliser used on the farms’ fields to the fuel they use. The calculation model is based on Valio’s development work over the past decades, and it is Carbon Trust certified.    \n\n\n“What’s needed at the foundation of our climate work are reliable carbon footprint figures, but the most important thing is the work on the carbon footprint, that is, what changes we are making. One of the most important features of the CARBO® climate calculator is to identify the effect of our climate work on reducing our carbon footprint”, sums up Juha Nousiainen.\n\n\n“We congratulate Valio for setting science-based targets consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement,” said \nCynthia Cummis\n, Director of Private Sector Climate Mitigation at World Resources Institute, one of the Science Based Targets initiative partners. “By aligning its goals with a 1.5°C future, Valio will be better placed to thrive as the global economy transitions to a zero emissions future”.\n\n\nRead more about Valio’s activities to reduce its carbon footprint:\n\n \n\n\n* the Science Based Targets initiative provides companies a tool to plan their climate activities to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement. The Science Based Targets initiative aims for companies to have environmental targets that are based on science and that create significant emission reductions. It is backed by the WWF, the UN Global Compact, CDP, and the World Resources Institute. Science Based Targets assesses and approves the companies’ efforts in a science-based, independent manner. Internationally, the initiative includes over a thousand companies; currently, 29 companies in Finland have set or committed to set science-based emission reduction targets. Valio is the second Finnish food company that has set SBT targets. More information: \nScience Based Targets\n\n\n**The average carbon footprint for milk at a Valio dairy farm is equivalent to 0.8–1.3 kg of CO2 per litre of milk. Milk’s average carbon footprint globally is equivalent to ca. 2.5 kg of CO2 per litre (\nFAO\n).  In the global scale, Finnish milk has a low carbon footprint.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nFood packaging and packaging materials are small things of great importance in our daily lives. The purpose of packaging is to protect the food, ensure hygiene and improve the shelf life of the product. Packaging accounts for only a small share of the product’s carbon footprint, but it still has an important role in Valio’s climate work as a whole. In 2020, 24 per cent of Valio’s plastic packaging was plant-based. The amount of packaging produced from recycled plastic was 250 tonnes, which is equivalent to 10.9 million half-litre bottles used in the deposit-refund system.\n\n\nPlastic is a much discussed topic because of its environmental impacts. Packaging usually only accounts for a few per cent of the carbon footprint of an individual product, but the combined effect of millions and millions of packages makes the choice of materials significant. \n\n\nThe most important purpose of packaging is to protect the food. In the case of food products, the greatest waste is spoiled food that has to be disposed of. So far, the properties of plastic make it by far the best raw material for safe food packaging and the prevention of food waste. Therefore, Valio is trying to use it even more environmentally wisely and more efficiently. \n\n\n“Hundreds of different products are manufactured every day at Valio’s plants in Finland alone, and roughly a billion pieces of product packaging are used each year. Last year, we removed plastic lids and spoons from the packaging of Valio PROfeel® puddings, and this alone reduced the annual consumption of plastic packaging by approximately 150,000 kilos. This is equivalent to about seven million plastic carrier bags”, says \nJuhana Pilkama\n, who is responsible for packaging development at Valio. \n\n\nCutting down on plastics is one of Valio’s own sustainability targets, and many environmentally friendly innovations are created thanks to ordinary shoppers.\n\n\n“We have received a lot of feedback calling for a reduction in the use of plastic. In 2020, we reduced our plastic use by a total of 485,000 kilos. For example, Valio’s cheese slices now come in thinner packages than before, and in the spring of 2021, paper straws will replace plastic ones in Valio Grandi® juice cartons. Smart, environmentally savvy packaging also makes recycling at home easier. The redesigned cheese package can be squeezed into a small ball, and it takes up little space in the plastic collection box”, Pilkama continues. \n\n\nIn addition, Valio is currently updating the recycling labels on its packages. Plain-language recycling labels on packaging are now even easier to find, making the everyday life of consumers easier.\n\n\nRecycled plastic bottles get a new life on the cheese shelf\n\n\nValio was one of the first food companies to start using recycled plastic packaging in 2019. Recycled plastic bottles are recycled in cheese packaging – plastic bottles recycled in Finland make up for more than half of the new cheese slice packages. Recycled plastic is used in the packaging of Valio MiFU® products and triangular gourmet cheeses. We have also stopped using black plastic in packaging because it is difficult to recycle at plastic recycling facilities. \n\n\nValio has worked systematically to minimise the environmental impact of its products. All Valio packaging has been compatible with collection systems since 2010. In 2020, 24 per cent of Valio’s plastic packaging was plant-based. The amount of packaging materials produced from recycled plastic was 250 tonnes, which is equivalent to 10.9 million half-litre bottles used in the deposit-refund system. This year, we are gradually introducing plastic cups that are suitable for cardboard recycling. This will significantly reduce the amount of plastic we use.\n\n\nGoing forward, Valio will continue to reduce the use of plastic in general and increase the use of recycled plastic, as well as favouring plant-based materials in its packaging. The circular economy is also becoming more important.\n\nJuhana Pilkama says that plastic is not a bad packaging material, but what happens to the plastic packaging after use can make it harmful to the environment.\n\n\n“The versatile utilisation of recycled plastic is important. This is still a new challenge for us and our industry. Our goal is to reduce our use of plastic by 20 per cent by 2025, to keep increasing our use of plant-based packaging materials and to make recycling even easier, for example, by labelling. It’s important for us to continue combating food waste, and packaging is key in this fight. Plastic cannot yet be completely replaced in the packaging of long-life food products. However, we are striving to reduce the amount of plastic to a minimum, without compromising the product’s shelf life”, Juhana Pilkama sums up.\n\n\nValio’s goal is to reset milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035.\n\n"

Many fields and businesses have had a very challenging year, and many have had to make changes in their operation and find new ways to work. Sustainability has grown in importance amidst the pandemic. Finland’s food industry has shown its ability to function in an emergency, and our meaningful role in society shows in the survey”, says Sustainable Brand Index founder \nErik Elvingsson Hedén\n.\n\n\n“During the pandemic, sustainable food and the security of food supply have risen in prominence. Many in Finland have begun to notice what kind of strength a vibrant Finnish agriculture and food companies can be in a crisis”, Annikka Hurme finishes. \n\n\nValio’s sustainability work has not slowed down in the pandemic\n\n\nWhat’s core to Valio’s sustainability work is its ambitious goal to reset milk production’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. The emergency of the pandemic has not influenced the progress of Valio’s sustainability work, on the contrary. \n\n\n“We want to be a part of the solution to global challenges: we are aware of our environmental and climate effects and take active measures to reduce them through renewing carbon farming, manure-based biogas and other plant and farm-specific emission reduction measures. All the while, we are determined to improve animal and human welfare”, says Valio’s SVP for Group Sustainability, \nHanna Hiekkamies\n.\n\n\nValio’s operation is based on co-operatives that is owned by 4,300 Finnish dairy farmers, which produces a billion euros for Finland’s society every year, and pays out all its profits to the dairy farms. Finns feel very strongly about Valio’s products and production being local. \n\n\n“We create work and wellbeing everywhere in Finland. This is our way to make sure that we have access to locally produced food whose origin we know, from the farm to the dairy. Today, what’s most important to us is taking care of our personnel and our dairy farmers, managing their wellbeing and strength so that we can continue our work towards carbon-neutral milk production as well as our other sustainability targets. We are well on our way towards reaching them already”, finishes Hanna Hiekkamies.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nReducing HGV traffic emissions is an important part of Finland’s 2035 carbon-neutrality target. One of its solutions can be found in cow manure: it can be made into biogas that can, in the future, replace fossil diesel fuel, which is what HGVs in Finland currently run on. The Vuorenmaa dairy farm has written a new page for the history books, as Finland’s first manure-powered milk truck filled up with the farm’s own renewable biogas. \n\n\nThe Vuorenmaa dairy farm, in Haapavesi, has 180 cows that produce milk for Valio’s local dairy, where it is made into Valio Oltermanni® cheese. For years, the farm has used the manure its cows produce to generate electricity and heat for the farm at their own biogas plant. For the first time, that biogas has begun to fuel a Valio milk truck. Using biogas as vehicle fuel is a part of Valio’s programme that aims to reset milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035.\n  \n\n\n“The Vuorenmaa farm’s biogas plant currently produces roughly 1,900 Mwh of biogas every year. We were overhauling the plant’s equipment and decided to expand its functions to produce biogas fuel. The milk truck from our local dairy at Haapavesi can fill up at our farm at the same time as they collect our milk. In the future, the fuelling station near the farm will also provide biogas for passenger cars”, says \nJanne Vuorenmaa\n, who runs the farm with his brother and family.\n\n\nIn the beginning, half of the gas they produce will be refined into biomethane, which is suited for use as vehicle fuel. If all that gas were to be used in milk trucks, it would be enough for a mileage of over 350,000 kilometres per year. For now, there is only a limited amount of biogas for passenger cars. It will be possible, however, to increase the plant’s refining capacity to meet demand.\n\n\nManure-based biogas is a significant reduction on agricultural and traffic emissions\n\n\nRoughly 15 million tonnes of manure is generated every year in Finland. Usage of agricultural side flows is, however, still taking its early steps in Finland, and using pressurised biogas that is made of cow manure is a completely new development. Biogas will also play an important role in reducing not only traffic emissions, but also in reducing agricultural ones. \n\n\n“The biogas plant is a part of our farm’s regular nutrient circle. Its process transforms the nutrients in the manure into a form that is more useful in the fields. When we need to buy less fertilizer, it benefits both the environment and our accounts. It also improves the farm’s self-sufficiency when it comes to energy. Selling farm-produced fuel is another business opportunity”, says Janne Vuorenmaa. \n\n\n“Using biogas can reduce fuel’s lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 85 percent compared to diesel, which is what our milk collection and distribution trucks run on. At the same time, the dairy farm’s own carbon footprint goes down significantly, by one fourth or fifth, depending on the method of calculation”, says Valio’s Development Manager \nPetteri Tahvanainen\n, who is responsible for Valio’s vehicle fleet.\n\n\n“The Vuorenmaa dairy farm is a fantastic example of the ways Finnish farmers can solve environmental and climate challenges together with local businesses. At the same time, the farms can create new business, that is, new cashflow into the countryside, while improving our fuel-related self-sufficiency”, continues Tahvanainen.\n\n\nLocal cooperation\n\n\nThe biogas plant and the biomethane refining and refuelling station was manufactured by Demeca Oy, a company local to Haapavesi. \n\n\n“We have spent a long time developing our biomethane refining unit and trialled various technical solutions. Now, a milk truck can refuel at the farm every day and the equipment is running well”, says Demeca Sales Director \nSami Vinkki\n.\n\n\n“We want to create new business opportunities for farmers and to improve the field’s respectability. Our job is to improve farm profitability as well as animal and human wellbeing. This is yet another project where that has been a resounding success. I very much like to refuel one of our cars at a customer’s farm. And the farm gets to keep all the profit”, says Vinkki.“A network of various local businesses has formed around the Vuorenmaa farm. They are close to the Haapavesi Cheese Factory, which means it is easy to refuel the milk truck during its collection run”, says Pohjolan Maito cooperative’s Managing Director \nMarko Puhto\n.\n\n\nThe milk is collected from the farm with transportation business H. Vähäaho Oy’s new milk truck.\n\n\n“When this project started about a year ago, we were very excited. It’s been a joy to see that all our partners have been just as excited to take part. There have been no significant surprises, as everything worked as planned, both for the refuelling system and the truck. Some people may say that such as small act is not enough to save the world, but we are excited to be a part of such a chain that can result in concrete reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the places that we live and breathe”, says H. Vähäaho Oy’s \nSami Vähäaho\n.\n\n"

The free online course is the result of a collaborative effort led by the environmental foundation Baltic Sea Action Group (BSAG) and the technology company Reaktor, and is based on the Carbon Action project, which was launched with support from Sitra and the Finnish Meteorological institute. The course was created in collaboration with farmers, researchers, and operators in the Finnish food chain.\n\n\nRegenerative agriculture is a significant tool for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Research has shown that this approach to agriculture has multiple benefits: it increases productivity while also protecting climate, waters, and biodiversity. Regenerative agriculture enhances soil health thus improving food security and helping food production adapt to extreme weather caused by climate change.\n\n\nThe new online course provides sixty hours’ worth of diverse learning materials and farming practices that can be applied on the farm. The aim is to have 5,000 farmers attend the course in the first year, which is roughly ten percent of Finnish farmers.\n\n\n“Regenerative agriculture is a rising phenomenon around the world. Our online course makes the most up-to-date knowledge available to tens of thousands of farmers. Since online training makes large-scale implementation of the methods possible, the course has sparked widespread international interest even before the it has been officially launched”, says \nNiko Kavenius,\n Lead Designer at\n \nReaktor. \n\n\nMore carbon is stored in the soil than in the atmosphere and all vegetation combined. Climate change can be mitigated by sequestering carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in the soil through agricultural practices. If all of Finland’s farms on mineral soil would succeed in sequestering carbon through regenerative agriculture, five megatons of carbon dioxide could be removed from the atmosphere, an amount equivalent to the annual emissions from the entire country’s personal car traffic. \n\n\n“Climate change is the greatest of the threats facing the Baltic Sea. We have reason to be hopeful because the same agricultural practices can mitigate both climate change and the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea, while also improving the profitability of agriculture. The E-college offers all Finnish farmers an equal opportunity to improve their yield and set an example that can be copied anywhere”, says \nMichaela Ramm-Schmidt,\n Managing Director at BSAG.\n\n\nFinland is among the trailblazers of regenerative agriculture. The Carbon Action project, launched in 2017 by BSAG, Sitra and the Finnish Meteorological Institute, researches and develops ways to accelerate soil carbon sequestration and verifies the results scientifically. Cutting-edge research and practical trials within food production is carried out in collaboration with farmers and companies. The E-college makes the results of the work done on one hundred pilot farms available to all. \n\n\n“Yields and crop security have improved since I began applying the principles of regenerative agriculture. Costs have decreased and the handling of animals has become easier with rotational grazing. It is easy to first test these methods on just a few fields”, says \nTuomas Näppilä\n, course attendee and farmer from Kestilä, Urjala.\n\n\nCollaboration throughout the food chain for the good of the climate\n\n\nThe partnership behind the E-college for Regenerative Agriculture makes the course particularly influential. The E-college is backed by the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, agricultural producer unions, and several large operators in the Finnish food chain who have committed to ambitious sustainability targets in the production chain. \n\n\n“Environmental issues are becoming increasingly important to people but making sustainable choices is difficult in practice. It is important for us to train our dairy producers in order to achieve carbon neutrality in the whole milk chain in the future. This way we can offer consumers Finnish products that are produced using regenerative farming practices”, says \nJuha Nousiainen,\n Director of the unit Carbon-neutral Milk Chain at Valio.\n \n\n\n“Regenerative agriculture proves that practical solutions to biodiversity loss and the climate crisis exist. Finnish farmers can be at the frontline supporting biodiversity and sequestering carbon into soil. Sitra wants to facilitate this important work”, says \nMari Pantsar\n, Director of Sustainability Solutions at Sitra.\n\n\nIn addition to Sitra, the Finnish Meteorological Institute and Valio, the partnership behind the course includes ProAgria, Fazer, S Group, Atria, City of Lahti and Viking Malt. The course is also sponsored by MTK (the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners) and the SLC (the Central Union of Swedish-speaking Agricultural Producers in Finland). The course will be published on 9th February 2021, and it is free of charge to all participants.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nFrom the beginning of 2021, all 4,300 Valio dairy farms commit to Valio’s sustainability criteria. Every dairy farm supplying milk to Valio is now paid a sustainability bonus of two cents per litre. In order to receive the bonus, the farm must practice preventive animal healthcare and systematic monitoring of animal welfare.\n\n\nSince 2018 Valio has paid a sustainability bonus to those dairy farms committed to taking voluntary actions to improve animal welfare. About 98 per cent of the milk Valio received in 2020 came from farms receiving a sustainability bonus. Since the beginning of 2021, all dairy farms supplying milk to Valio meet the sustainability criteria. \n\n\n“Dairy farms have persistently worked to improve animal welfare. Three years ago we set a target of all Valio dairy farms committing to the actions required for the sustainability bonus by the beginning of 2021 to improve animal welfare. We have now reached our target,” says \nIlkka Pohjamo, \nSVP, primary production at Valio.\n \n\n\nThe sustainability programme requires farms to take measures to improve the welfare of cows beyond what is required by the Animal Welfare Act. A veterinarian makes a healthcare visit to the farm at least once a year to assess the animal welfare and practices at the farm, and to set goals for the farm for the upcoming year. The goals and corrective measures are recorded in Naseva, the Centralised Health Care Register for Finnish Cattle Herds. Other requirements for receiving the sustainability bonus include regular hoof treatment, and the use of anaesthetics, sedation and pain relief during disbudding, i.e. the removal of a calf’s horn buds. The sustainability criteria also require that any new barns built at the dairy farm must be freestall barns, which allow the cows to move about freely. \n\n\n“Animal welfare is a prerequisite for our business – both ethically and from the perspective of financial profitability. Cows that are well cared for are healthier and more productive, and they produce high-quality milk,” says Pohjamo. \n\n\nDairy farmers own Valio through cooperatives. Milk producers are pleased that all farms are now part of the shared sustainability programme.\n\n\n“Taking care of animal welfare is the most important thing and a matter of course for us dairy farmers. With the sustainability programme, all farms are now on a more level playing field with each other with everyone committed to the common way of operating and to an independent, impartial veterinarian continuously monitoring the welfare of cows and reporting the results to Naseva,” notes \nKati Montonen\n, a milk producer from Pertunmaa, Southern Finland. The Montonens have invested in giving cows daily, year-round outdoor access and in the gentle weaning of calves.\n\n\nDevelopment of Valio’s sustainability programme continues\n\n\nDeveloping the sustainability of milk production is an ongoing and goal-oriented effort at Valio. Along with animal welfare, the core of the sustainability programme development includes zeroing carbon emissions from milk production.\n\n\n“Going forward, our focus will be on increasing grazing and year-round outdoor activity. Currently, grazing of one or more animal groups occurs at some 70 per cent of farms. We will also continue efforts to reduce climate emissions from milk production with many farm-specific measures, like carbon farming and biogas production from cattle manure. The measures to be taken at Valio’s dairy farms will have a big impact on the sustainability of Finland’s milk production; about 80 per cent of Finnish milk is produced at Valio’s dairy farms. That’s why our efforts are so impactful,” says Pohjamo.\n\n"

In addition, Valio Akatemia® has chosen to grant a special €3000 scholarship, that will be handed over at the Sports Gala on 14 January to floorball club Vihdin Salisudet.\n\n\nValio Akatemia® received over 2,000 applications, from which we have chosen 336 fellows. Any individual athlete under 18, team and school group in Finland that either participates or is interested in sports can apply. Valio Akatemia® supports youngsters that are either looking to start a sports hobby or wish to continue one, as well as ones that have already seen success and who have long-term goals.\n\n\n“Sports and exercise are significant to children and young people. We want to show a variety of support to sports hobbies: our fellows represent every region in Finland; they are of all ages and participate in a great variety of sports: from individual sports to team sports, from individual applicants to teams as well as school groups”, says Valio marketing manager \nNina Wahlström\n.\n\n\nThe programme’s sponsors, footballer \nJoel Pohjanpalo\n, skiier \nKerttu Niskanen\n, hurdles runner and orienteer \nTopi Raitanen\n, and skiing YouTubers Real Skifi were all involved in the final selection. Stipendiates include competitive athletes as well as children and young people that are early in their sports hobbies.\n\n\nFrom tricking to trials\n\n\nEvery year, new sportspeople find the Valio Akatemia® stipend application process. The fellows chosen this year include, in addition to traditional favourites, sports such as tricking and trials. Sports often combines with art, and some of our support has been given to children’s dance theatre and classical ballet.\n\n\n”It’s important for us to encourage children and young people to be active in their personally preferred way. What’s most important is the joy of sports”, says Wahlström.\n\n\nIn 2021, Valio Akatemia® gives out 336 cash, product and nutrition stipends. Cash and product stipends are used for, among others, to pay for memberships, facility rent, coach and season fees as well as race travel and equipment purchases. \n\n\nNutritional stipends, on the other hand, support the athletes’ overall wellbeing with snack and cooking courses and nutritional coaching. Coaching and courses are carried out jointly with the Martha Organization, which is a home economics organisation, and the Finnish Sports and Exercise Safety Program.\n\n\nSpecial stipend ensures sports activity close to children\n\n\nValio Akatemia® grants an annual special scholarship, which is presented at the Sports Gala, Finland’s premier event, on January 14. The fellow must be an example of promoting sports, wellbeing and development for children and young people. Their activities must represent the joy of sports, a sense of community, small and large success, motivated and engaged children and youth, and adults involved in the activities. The activities must be persistent and show a pioneering spirit.\n\n\n“We chose floorball club Vihdin Salisudet’s C1 boys’ team, i.e. the team of boys born in 2005. One year ago, the team was in a tight spot as players began to transfer to the clubs in neighbouring towns, as the coaching team broke apart. Through determined cooperation, their new coach and the players made it possible to keep their activities in their home town, their own club, and with their friends. Their efforts also led to success, as the team broke through to the first youth division for the first time in the club’s history”, says Nina Wahlström.\n\n\nThe special scholarship is worth €3,000, and the team plans to use it on enabling goal-oriented floorball activities in Vihti.\n\n\nFurther information: \nAll 2021 stipendiates have been notified personally. The stipend application process for 2022 will begin in summer 2021. Anyone under 18 that lives in Finland and either participates or is interested in sports can apply. Applicants can be individual athletes, teams, a class of children.\n\n"

At the new digital event Fi Connect 2020 in November, Valio will host three Exhibitor Showcases related to Healthy Ageing, Lactose free opportunities in dairy business, and What’s new in milk fat and infant nutrition.\n\n\nPeople are increasingly aware of the importance of health and wellbeing, and how food and good nutrition plays an important role in everyday life. As the world becomes more complex, consumers are re-evaluating where they place their trust. They are looking for products and producers that are genuine, honest, and transparent in all actions. And factors such as sustainability, food safety, traceability and purity of raw materials are more important than ever.\n\n\nTimo Pajari\n, SVP, Food Solutions Sales, said: “We have also just launched Valio Eila™ NUTRI F+, our milk protein powder blend for ageing nutrition, in Europe, Asia and the USA. The world is ageing, and older adults want to stay active and energetic, maintain their mental health, and enjoy the taste of food. In fact, their quality of life depends on it. As a result, ageing adults are willing to invest in food products that support these objectives. This is a great opportunity for the food industry.”\n\n\nSugar reduction without artificial sweeteners \n\n\nSugar is increasingly overtaking fat and salt as a primary consumer concern, especially as high sugar consumption is blamed for rising obesity rates and is linked to many health issues. Consumers are actively looking for reduced sugar options in categories like dairy, ice-cream, bakery, confectionery or chocolate.\n\n\nProtein is still the new black \n\n\nProtein hits the sweet spot of many global food trends, it has a clear link to health and wellness as well as naturality. Protein is no longer a niche market of workout enthusiasts, but an important part of a normal, healthy lifestyle, and has a lot of potential in snacks and indulgence products.\n\n\nLactose free potential\n\n\nAround 70 percent of the world’s population suffers from lactose intolerance. The awareness of digestive wellness and lactose intolerance is increasing all over the world, and people are looking for ways to adjust their diet. This means that there is a rapidly growing demand for healthy and great tasting lactose-free products in categories still underdeveloped in lactose free, such as ice-cream, milk chocolate, bakery, or special nutrition.\n\n\nIndulgent experience\n\n\nValio also offers butter especially for industrial customers. Valio butter is used by bakeries, the processed food industry, ice cream makers, and dairies. Butter made from Finnish high-quality milk can be tasted in croissants baked by some of the leading French bakeries. \n\n\nTailored solutions from fully integrated process\n\n\n“While demand is fragmented, Valio is well equipped to offer tailored, or one-fit, solutions that enable our customers to respond to profitable growth opportunities and maintain production efficiency. Our investment in the Valio Lapinlahti factory offers new dry blend and packaging possibilities (IMF grade) also on a short timeline,” Pajari continues.\n\n\nCome and see how Valio’s pioneering dairy ingredients and solutions can improve your business. \n\n\nDuring the virtual event, Valio will host three Exhibitor Showcases (available also on demand):\n\n\n23 November 12.30 (CET) – How to create nutritional solutions for Healthy Ageing\n\n\n24 November 11.30 (CET) – Value adding Lactose free opportunities in dairy business  \n\n\n25 November 11.30 (CET) – What’s new in milk fat and infant nutrition\n\n\nYou can register here\n\n\nMore information\n\n"

Packaging has a vitally important task – to prevent food waste, which is a major environmental hazard. Plastic becomes a problem if it ends up in nature. Valio is determined to reduce the amount of plastic used for packaging and to increase the proportion of recycled plastic used. All our packaging is recyclable.\n\n\nDuring the autumn, we will discontinue the use of covers with plastic spoons for Valio PROfeel® quarks and puddings. This reduces the amount of plastics used in these packages by a whopping 44 per cent. That means about 150,000 kg of plastic a year, an amount that corresponds to about seven million plastic bags!We are also making a partial shift to recycled plastic packaging for all of Valio’s cheese slices, and their overall plastic content is also being reduced. More than 55 per cent of packaging material is made from recycled plastic in Finland. Thinner packaging saves 70,000 kg of plastic per year. Thinner packaging is easier to squeeze into a small area to save space in rubbish bins and in rubbish transportation.\n\n\nRead more about package development at Valio\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nSoon it will be possible to fill up the tank with biogas made from cattle manure at the Vuorenmaa dairy farm in Haapavesi. In addition to the milk truck, there is enough for other drivers of gas-powered vehicles to purchase it from ordinary gas meters. Using pressurised biogas produced from cow manure for transportation purposes is new in Finland. Biogas will have an important role in reducing transport emissions because it will replace fossil fuels, i.e. diesel and petrol. At the same time, it’ll significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the dairy farm. Utilising biogas as a transport fuel is part of Valio’s efforts to cut the carbon footprint of milk to zero by 2035.\n\n\nBrothers \nJanne and Ville Vuorenmaa\n and their families run a dairy farm of 180 cows in Haapavesi. Milk from the Vuorenmaa farm is used to make Valio Oltermanni® cheese at Valio’s Haapavesi cheese plant. \n\n\nThe Vuorenmaa dairy farm has its own biogas plant that produces about 1,200 MWh of biogas per year. Biogas has already been used to produce the electricity and heat needed at the farm, but now the biogas plant has been expanded. Initially, about half of the gas will be refined into biomethane for use in transportation. The fill-up station will be ready by the end of the year, and then the milk truck will start filling up its biogas tank at the farm. At first, there will be a limited supply of biogas available to passenger cars. As the demand grows, the refining capacity can be increased. If all the biogas were to be used by passenger cars, there would be enough for 85 cars to drive 20,000 kilometres in a year*. \n\n\n“We have had our own biogas plant for 15 years. Previously, we got heat and electricity from cow manure to meet the needs of our own farm. When it was time to renew the equipment, we decided that we could expand and produce biogas also for transportation. The milk truck will start using the farm’s biogas later this year. Around the same time, a fill-up station for other motorists will be opened along Virtala road,” \nJanne Vuorenmaa\n says. \n\n\nValio is aiming to cut milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. This can be achieved by reducing emissions at dairy farms, in transportation and at plants, and by increasing the carbon sinks of fields through carbon farming; Valio and the Baltic Sea Action Group have teamed up to provide training to dairy farmers. The Vuorenmaa farm is one of the carbon farms.\n\n\n“The Vuorenmaa dairy farm is a good example of how Finnish farmers can solve climate challenges. At the same time, the farms can generate new business. Utilising manure for biogas production reduces the carbon footprint of milk produced at the farm by one quarter or one fifth, depending on the way it’s calculated,” says Valio’s \nJuha Nousiainen\n, SVP, Carbon-neutral milk chain. \n\n\nUsing biogas can reduce as much as 85 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions created during the life cycle of fuel, compared to diesel fuel.\n\n\nManure is an untapped treasure\n\n\nAbout 15 million tonnes of manure is generated in Finland every year. Its odour is familiar to most people around farms, especially in the spring. The manure smell significantly decreases in the biogas process. In addition, the manure nutrients are in a more soluble form than in ordinary manure. When the fertiliser is more effective, less purchased fertiliser is needed. And there is less nutrient runoff into water systems. \n\n\n“A network of local operators has emerged around the\n \nVuorenmaa dairy farm. The farm is located close to the Haapavesi cheese plant, so filling up along the milk truck’s route is convenient. Demeca, the supplier of the biogas plant, is a Haapavesi-based company, and so is the H. Vähäaho transport company that collects the milk with its new truck. This is local collaboration at its best,” says\n Marko Puhto\n, Managing Director of Cooperative Osuuskunta Pohjolan Maito\n. \n\n\n“We want to create new business opportunities for farmers and elevate the valuation of the sector. Our mission is to improve the profitability of farms and the wellbeing of people and animals. With the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a lot of talk about Finland’s security of supply. What we have here is one way to increase fuel self-sufficiency. Today most transport fuel is imported. Demeca’s technology has been developed at our family farm here in Haapavesi. One of my big dreams will become reality when I’m able to fill up my own gas-powered vehicle in my home village, at my customer’s farm, and the money stays with the farmers – with no middle man involved,” says  Demeca’s Sales Director \nSami Vinkki.\n\n\n“Our whole team got excited about the gas vehicle project. Our first milk truck hit the road exactly 60 years ago. It’s great to continue being part of developing the sector,” says H. Vähäaho transport company’s\n Sami Vähäaho\n.\n\n\n*If all the gas were to be used for passenger cars, with average consumption, there would be enough to drive about 1.67 million kilometres, i.e. for 85 passenger cars to drive 20,000 km in a year. \n\n\nBackground information:\n\n\nThe biogas plant has been designed as a part of the farm’s normal nutrient cycling. It increases the farm’s energy self-efficiency, improves nutrient use and decreases the environmental impacts of the nutrients. \n\n\nSee Demeca’s website for more information about biogas production at a dairy farm\n\n\n\n\nAlmost one third of the energy in the grass eaten by a cow ends up in manure. Manure can be used to make biogas as a replacement for fossil-based transport fuels. Manure also contains nitrogen and phosphor, valuable nutrients that plants need.\n\n\t \n\n\nRight now there are some 20 biogas plants on Valio dairy farms. The energy they produce is currently used mainly to produce electricity and heat for the farms. The electricity used in Finland is primarily low-carbon nuclear, hydro and bioenergy. When biogas is used as a replacement for fossil fuels in transportation, the emissions reduction is bigger. \n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio Group’s net sales were EUR 1,787 million in 2019, representing 3 percent growth from the previous year (EUR 1,734 million). Domestic net sales increased by half a percent and international net sales by about 7 percent. The work that began in 2018 to improve business profitability advanced as planned and was reflected in the improvement in the milk return.\n\n\nValio pays all profit to dairy farms \n\n\n\nValio is a company owned by 4,700 Finnish milk producers, and Valio pays its operating profit to the dairy farms through the co-operatives. Valio’s financial success is measured with a milk margin and a milk return. The milk margin** in 2019 amounted to EUR 838 million (800 million), and the milk return* was 41.2 cents per litre (38.4 c/l). \n\n\nValio’s Board of Directors determines the raw milk price based on the market situation and Valio’s financial standing. Board members are milk producers. In 2019, the average price Valio paid for milk was 39.9 cents per litre (39.2 c/l). After-payments for 2019 amounted to 1 cent per litre. The sustainability bonus to encourage the continuous improvement of animal welfare was raised to two cents per litre in July. \n\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Valio has been able to pay Finnish milk producers a higher price than the European average.  \n\n\nGrowth in Finland from snacks and plant-based products\n\n\n\nGrowth in Finland was generated especially in snacks and plant-based products. Valio PROfeel® products continued their strong growth, and the new protein puddings launched in February were a success. The portfolio of plant-based products expanded with Valio Oddlygood® Veggie slices and shreds. The Valio Oddlygood® Barista oat drink developed in collaboration with coffee professionals found its way into the hearts of people in Finland and Sweden. In the traditional categories, milks continued to decline in line with the market trend.\n\n\nIncrease in exports of powders generating customer value \n\n\n\nNet sales of international operations were EUR 715 million (669 million). Net sales growth was moderate in the nearby markets of Sweden, Estonia and Russia, while net sales in China grew by close to 40 percent compared to the previous year. We see potential in China especially in special ingredients for the food industry, which we call value-added powders. Profitability improvement in the USA advanced as planned. \n\n\nValio’s share of Finland’s total food exports is about 25 percent. A significant share of our exports is destined for places beyond the nearby countries. Our primary exports to countries around the world are milk powders, cheese and butter. The global market price of butter decreased compared to the high level in 2018, but milk powder prices developed favourably after the depletion of the EU intervention stocks. \n\n\nThe so-called value-added powders have attributes that bring Valio’s industrial customers various benefits: for example, a bakery or confectioner can reduce sugar, or a maker of energy snacks for athletes can add protein to their products. Sales of value-added ingredients grew by about 30 percent in 2019. \n\n\n“We see international growth potential especially in value-added ingredients. The growth is currently limited by the drying capacity of powders because it takes longer to produce value-added powders than ordinary milk powders. In the years ahead, we will be upgrading the production lines to increase plant capacity,” says Valio’s CEO \nAnnikka Hurme\n. \n\n\nThree-year profitability improvement programme\n\n\nIn 2018, Valio initiated a three-year programme focused on improving competitiveness and profitability. The programme advanced as planned, which was visible in the improved milk return. At the beginning of 2019, Valio renewed its organisation and management model. The cooperation negotiations targeting head office functions resulted in a reduction of 80 employees. During the first four months of 2020, Valio signed contracts with milk producer co-operatives on the raw milk volumes that Valio will receive in the upcoming years.\n \n\n\n\n“Contract production makes it possible for us to better predict the milk volume and\n \nincrease the capacity for value-added ingredients. The better the milk volume and production match domestic and export market demand, the better the chances of future success for both Valio and our owners – the 4,700 Finnish dairy farms,” \nHurme\n says. \n\n\nLegal proceedings completed\n\n\nIn July 2019, the District Court of Helsinki gave its ruling in the claim for damages related to milk pricing. Valio was ordered to pay damages arising from 2010-2012 and amounting to 3.5 million euros for the Maitokolmio co-operative and 4.5 million euros for the Maitomaa co-operative, as well as statutory interest and some legal expenses for both. \n\n\nValio is part of the climate change solution\n\n\nThe climate change discussion accelerated in 2019, and people are expecting companies to come up with concrete solutions to reduce emissions. Valio’s ambitious climate work continued in 2019. Our goal is to reduce the carbon footprint of milk to zero by 2035. We established a Carbon-neutral Milk Chain team, and we worked actively to find new emissions-reducing solutions in our milk chain. We have taken concrete measures, including the training of 240 dairy farm entrepreneurs to become carbon farmers, i.e. to sequester more carbon in their fields, we started using recycled plastic in our packaging, we advanced the development of a carbon footprint calculator, and we were the first Finnish food company to commit to setting scientifically assessed climate targets in line with the Paris Agreement. Additionally, we arranged several different events that focused on ways to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands drained from wetlands. \n\n\n“We believe there is a place for sustainably produced Finnish dairy products also in the future. The way we produce milk differs quite a bit from many other countries. The cows primarily eat grass, no soy at all. Towards the end of the chain, the climate impacts are reduced through energy efficiency improvements at plants, optimised transport routes, eco-friendly packaging, and reduced waste in production. We take our climate targets seriously. We want people to be able to enjoy dairy products with a good conscience also in the future,” \nHurme\n emphasises. \n\n\nImproving efficiency continues in 2020 \n\n\nThis year has started under exceptional circumstances. The coronavirus pandemic that started in China at the beginning of 2020 will impact Valio’s operations both in Finland and abroad in many different ways for at least the first half of the year. The economic outlook in Finland is challenging. Consumer expectations regarding their own finances and the Finnish economy have weakened compared to last year, and the coronavirus pandemic will further weaken purchasing power. In all Valio’s markets, restaurant, hotel and industrial kitchen operations will be significantly affected in the months ahead. On the other hand, retail demand is growing as people are preparing more meals at home. \n\n\n“In Finland, Valio also plays an important role as part of security of supply and food security,” \nHurme\n notes. “In all our operations, we aim to serve customers and consumers in the best possible way. We are working in collaboration with co-operatives to support the dairy farm entrepreneurs, and we are doing our best to promote employee wellbeing and coping also during exceptional situations.” \n\n\nOther uncertainty factors in the operating environment include the impact of climate change on the prerequisites for global milk production and consumer habits, trade policy conflicts, and Britain’s exit from the European Union. \n\n\nValio will continue implementing its strategy in 2020 by developing its strong brands and by introducing new, innovative products that meet the changing needs of people. Internationally, Valio is pursuing growth particularly with value-added powders. Valio’s three-year project to improve cost efficiency and competitiveness, and consequently to improve the milk return, will continue as planned.\n\n\nValio Group’s key figures in 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2019\n\n\n2018\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet sales, MEUR\n\n\n 1,787\n\n\n 1,734\n\n\n 3.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk margin, MEUR\n\n\n 838\n\n\n 800\n\n\n 4.8%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk return, c/l\n\n\n 41.2\n\n\n 38.4\n\n\n 7.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk volume, ML\n\n\n 1,792\n\n\n 1,821\n\n\n-1.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity assets ratio\n\n\n 48%\n\n\n 44%\n\n\n 9.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments, MEUR\n\n\n 64\n\n\n 62\n\n\n 3.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Milk margin: Net sales less all other costs excluding the price paid to the owners for raw milk, interest on shareholder loans, depreciation according to plan, supplementary payments to the pension fund, pension contribution refunds, and items not included in actual business operations, such as sales gains from sales of business operations, and provisions, sales gains and losses from the sale of real estate, write-offs of fixed assets, and expenses arising from business acquisitions.

        "text": "\n\nThe dairy and food company Valio, owned by Finnish milk suppliers, has committed to set scientifically assessed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Science Based Targets). Valio had already announced that it is aiming for a net zero carbon footprint for milk by 2035. The targets to be set during 2020 are based on the Paris climate agreement: climate warming must be limited to 1.5°C.\n\n\nThe aim of the Science Based Targets (SBT) organisation is that companies’ climate targets are based on science and create significant reductions in emissions. Members of the organisation include WWF, UN Global Compact, CDP, and World Resources Institute. The Science Based Targets organisation scientifically and independently assesses and approves companies’ targets.\n\n\n– Climate change is the biggest global challenge of our time. We know the impacts of our own operations from the farm to the store shelf, and we want to be part of the solution. Big companies have a significant opportunity to make an impact and, at the same time, a responsibility to mitigate climate change. That is why we too are participating, says \nJuha Nousiainen\n, \nDirector of Valio’s carbon neutral milk chain.\n\n\nValio has an ambitious climate programme under way to bring the carbon footprint of milk to zero. Science-based SBT targets will be linked with the ongoing work and targets.\n\n\n– We were the first dairy in the world to publish over a year ago our climate programme aiming for carbon-neutral milk.  Our most important goals are to strengthen the carbon sinks of grasslands, reduce emissions from peatlands drained from wetlands, and put manure to use. In the future, manure will be increasingly used to produce biogas as a replacement for the fossil fuels used in transportation. At the same time, the valuable nutrients will be recycled. Naturally, we will reduce emissions also at production plants and in transportation.\n\n\nFor example, over 200 Valio dairy farms have participated in the carbon farmer training organised in collaboration with Baltic Sea Action Group. And the CARBO projects are researching carbon sequestration of grass in partnership with the Finnish Meteorological Institute, Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), University of Eastern Finland.\n\n\n– A significant share, over 90 per cent, of milk’s carbon footprint originates at the dairy farm before a milk truck enters the dairy gates. Clearly, the emissions of the entire value chain – from cows to production plants to logistics – will be part of our future SBT targets. More specific targets approved by an independent body will help us to advance in our climate work, Nousiainen adds. \n\n\nValio aims to receive approval for its Science Based Targets during 2020.\n\n\nRead more: Science Based Targets\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio’s aim is to cut the carbon footprint of milk to net zero by 2035. To accelerate its journey, the company is now launching a calculator that its farms can use to measure their own carbon emissions and identify the most effective actions to lower them. These actions are likely to result in dairy products with a lower carbon footprint. The methodology behind the tool is certified by global climate and sustainability experts, the Carbon Trust.\n\n\nEmissions from milk production can be reduced in many ways. One of the most important methods is carbon farming, i.e. farming methods that maximize the carbon sequestration capacity of fields. The carbon footprint also decreases by increasing the per-hectare harvest of grass for feeding cows. Cow welfare also has a big climate impact: emissions per litre of milk are reduced when cows live longer and produce milk well. The proper handling of manure also reduces emissions: tilling manure into soil rather than spraying it reduces nutrient runoff, and less industrial fertilizers are needed. Some dairy farms are already using their own biogas plants. The energy they produce from manure can be used to heat the farm and to power the milking equipment, for example. \n\n\nOver the decades, Finnish dairy farms have done a lot of work to reduce their carbon footprint. The global average carbon footprint of raw milk is currently 2.5 kg CO\n2\ne per litre \n(Source: FAO).\n In Finland, we estimate the figure is around 1 kg CO\n2\ne per litre. Using the calculator, emissions reductions can be measured and verified at the farm level. \n\n\n– Finnish cows’ methane emissions per litre of milk have halved in 50 years as a result of improved animal productivity, health, and nutrition. Cows today can produce more milk with the same amount of feed. Despite this development, our climate impact is still significant. We are humble about the challenges and we are pursuing ways to lower the figures even further. This is the first carbon footprint calculator in Finland developed specifically for dairy farms, says \nAleksi Astaptsev\n, Valio’s scientist who developed the calculation model. \n\n\nActions reducing emissions are also savings actions\n\n\nFarmers can play an important role in reducing carbon emissions because a big part of the footprint of food is generated in primary production. Valio is a company owned by 4,700 Finnish milk producers and it pays all its profits to the dairy farms. \n\n\nRami Rauhala\n and his wife Johanna operate a 65-cow dairy farm in Sievi, western Finland. The carbon footprint of the Hilliaho dairy farm was calculated as part of the work to develop the calculator.\n\n\n– Climate-smart milk production is also resource efficient, i.e. it makes good sense economically. Most of the fields on our farm are either grass silage or grazing pastures. We have also over-seeded to make the vegetation as thick as possible. In our area, the significance of reparcelling is also big. Parcels that have over time become fragmented have been reparcelled into feasible parcels among land owners. When fields are closer to the farm centre, tractors use less fuel. It has been great to notice that us milk producers are part of the solution to climate change. I believe that a growing share of consumers value our work as environmentally sustainable food producers, says Rauhala.\n\n\nValio’s goal is that all its farms are using the tool within the next five years. So far, data has been collected from 100 farms. \n\n\n– We have scheduled a training roadshow for dairy farms and we are providing them with online support, too. The calculator is easy to use and the farmers already have most of the data at hand. I estimate that the average farm can lower its emissions by 30 percent by 2025.  At the same time, we are of course working to reduce emissions from Valio’s factories, transportation and in packaging,” Astaptsev continues. \n\n\nCertified calculation model\n\n\nValio’s carbon footprint calculation uses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology and data from Valio’s own scientific work that started as animal nutrition research 10 years ago. \n\n\n– It is great to see Valio create this carbon calculator in order to help their farmers drive down their carbon emissions. It demonstrates the company’s commitment to minimising its emissions and we are pleased to have certified its calculator, says \nJohn Newton\n, Associate Director, Carbon Trust.\n\n\nValio will continue developing the carbon footprint calculator. Life cycle models for calculating the carbon footprint of food products do not currently include the soil’s carbon balance. So the carbon footprint of milk, or of any other food, doesn’t include the emissions or carbon binding of the soil. \n\n\n– Carbon binding in grass fields and emissions from farming peat fields should also be included in the calculations in order to get a more accurate picture of a food’s carbon footprint. Another area of development is combining the nutritional values of different foods with their carbon footprints,” Astaptsev concludes. \n\n\nBackground information\n\n\nCarbon footprint\n\n\nThe carbon footprint is a single-figure or range representation of a product or activity’s greenhouse emissions. Greenhouse gasses, such as methane, nitrogen oxide, and carbon dioxide, released by the product or activity are converted to a common format, the carbon dioxide equivalent. The carbon footprint is always an estimate and it varies between different farms.\n\n\nMilk’s carbon footprint \n\n\nCows convert the energy and nutrients in grass into milk. This is called rumination, and its price is the methane that is generated in the animal’s rumen. Most of milk production’s emissions (40-50%) are created in the cow’s rumen as well as in manure storage. The second largest share (35-45%) of the carbon footprint is generated in feed production, which releases nitrous oxide. The carbon dioxide generated in different stages of the production chain, e.g. in energy production for factors and in transportation, forms another notable part (10-15%) of the carbon footprint. \n\n\nGuidelines for calculating a carbon footprint \n\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, provides guidelines on calculating a food’s carbon footprint at three levels of accuracy. Valio uses the most accurate, i.e. level 3 guidelines, applicable to Finland. Most methods utilised to calculate the carbon footprint rely on general estimates found in external databanks.\n\n\nLevel 1:\n Emission factors are provided by IPCC\n\n\nLevel 2:\n Emission factors are calculated with IPCC-provided formulas and parameters\n\n\nLevel 3:\n Use of the most accurate national calculation methods, factors, and parameters \n\n\nEmission reductions vs. compensations\n\n\nIt’s also possible to compensate for carbon footprints, i.e. to offset emissions through external actions, such as afforestation projects in developing countries. This does not reduce or change a product’s true carbon footprint. At Valio, our priority is to focus on minimising the emissions in our own production chain in order to permanently reduce emissions. In 2020, we will set targets that are in line with the Paris Agreement: the temperature increase must be limited to 1.5 degrees.\n\n"

The reusable lids will be used to test the wood-based biocomposite in food packaging. The lids will be distributed through Valio’s promotional sales demonstrations early this year.\n\n\nAnnually about one third of the world’s food ends up as food waste or is thrown away (source: \nFAO\n). Food produced in vain is a waste of resources and generates unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. The packaging – and the lid – plays an important role in preventing food waste: the lid protects the food during storage.\n\n\n“With this pilot project we are encouraging people to take small, concrete actions to reduce food waste. The lid makes it easy to protect the unused crème fraiche or quark,” says \nJussi-Pekka Lumme\n, Packaging Development Manager at Valio. \n\n\nAt the same time, Valio and Stora Enso are testing how the biocomposite functions when combined with the food packaging. The lids are durable, washable and made from hygienic DuraSense® by Stora Enso, a biocomposite material that combines wood fibres and polymers. The biocomposite make it possible to cut the share of plastic in various products by as much as half and thus reduce the carbon footprint.\n\n\n“In 2018 we switched to fully plant-based packaging in all 250 million gable-top milk, yoghurt, cream, and sour milk packages. The packages are a part of our larger concept of aiming to reset milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. We are constantly exploring new packaging innovations to test and take into use,” says Jussi-Pekka Lumme.\n\n\n“We at Stora Enso see a strong demand for climate-friendly food packaging. The change is being driven by recognised product brands that are seeking eco-friendly solutions. We are actively developing innovative solutions that help food chains respond to consumer demands for sustainable selections,” says Stora Enso’s \nHannu Kasurinen\n, Executive Vice President, Packaging Materials. \n\n"

Valio took part in a joint research project headed by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, and the result was a prototype of a snack vending machine that dispenses fibre- and protein-rich snacks based on consumer preferences – quickly and flexibly.\n\n\nSnacks are an important part of dietary needs during a long day at work or school, and what’s in those snacks really does matter. A healthy snack helps to keep you alert and gives you added energy after your workday for physical fitness and other activities.  \n\n\n“Today people are increasingly more aware of their own personal needs and healthy lifestyles. Food also reflects different values and individual preferences. That’s why there is a growing demand for personalised, preference-based snacks that are easy and quick to prepare,” says \nKaisa Vehmas\n, VTT Senior Scientist and Project Manager\n.\n\n\nElina Kytö\n, Valio’s Senior Research Scientist working in consumer research, also believes in the demand for personalised food.\n\n\n“We no longer eat to live; instead, eating is an important part of personal wellbeing and it’s also a way to express yourself. The ability to customise your food to your own needs and preferences is a trend that is strongly on the upswing. This trend will increasingly impact Valio’s product development, as consumer awareness of their own wellbeing and personalised nutrition needs is growing,” notes Elina Kytö.\n\n\n\n\nPhotos: VTT\n\n\nA consumer test carried out in conjunction with the study indicated that there is great interest in a customisable snack product. \n\n\n“The prototype offers a spoonable or drinkable alternative, and the choice of a milk- or oat-based product to which the consumer can add protein and fibre, if desired. There will be more alternatives in the future,” Kaisa Vehmas believes. \n\n\nShe notes that snack vending machines similar to this prototype will eventually be located in places where people are on the move: at airports, train stations, workplaces and markets. Development of the service is limited only by the imagination. \n\n\n“The next step will certainly be to test a more comprehensive service that combines more specific information that consumers provide about their own preferences, their health, or, say, their exercise calendar. Based on the personal profile information, the service can suggest snacks that are suitable for a specific individual and a specific time of day, e.g. post-workday and pre-workout, and, likewise, what to avoid because of allergies, for instance,” Kaisa Vehmas describes.\n\n\nIn addition to Valio, the other companies participating in the VTT-headed FoodMyWay project were: Atria, Informa, JOBmeal, Miils, Nature Lyotech, PINC/Paulig and Raisio, whose expertise was utilised in the planning and testing of personalised snacks and in the building of the prototype.

As the world’s most innovative dairy, Valio has set an ambitious goal: carbon neutral dairy by 2035. This objective both helps to fight climate change and to provide food manufacturers with sustainably produced food ingredients.\n\n\nSustainably produced ingredients help food manufacturers compete in the market\n\n\nA sustainable production chain is a competitive advantage for food manufacturers who want to answer the market demand. Ingredient suppliers who are committed to sustainable operations can provide competitive edge to their customers in the food industry.\n\n\n“Our goal is to cut dairy’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. It is a good example of our concrete sustainability actions. Instead of just compensating for emissions, we are making major changes in our production chain in order to bring the carbon footprint of dairy down to zero in the future,” says \nTimo Pajari\n, SVP, Food Solutions Sales at Valio.\n\n\n“Our 2035 goal − carbon neutral dairy − means that the same amount of emissions is reduced and removed from the atmosphere as is generated on the farms, in transportation, at the plants, and in package manufacturing,” continues Pajari. \n\n\nSafety and quality of raw materials are also crucial elements of sustainability. Food manufacturers and consumers alike want to know where the raw materials come from. That is why traceability and transparent procurement are important customer requirements in ingredients sales.\n\n\n“Transparency is in the heart of Valio’s operations. All milk is traceable back to an individual farm. Finnish cows are among the healthiest in the world, and every cow at Valio farms even has a name,” Pajari says.\n\n\nThe entire dairy production chain under scrutiny for smaller carbon footprint\n\n\n“All Valio farms are becoming carbon farms, as we organise carbon farming trainings for Valio’s dairy farmers. In 2019–2020, we will train at least 200 volunteer farms. All Valio farms will complete the training by 2035,” says Pajari.\n\n\nAnother concrete climate action is the development of the new Valio CARBO® grass seed mix that further improves the carbon binding ability of grasslands.\n\n\nOther Valio’s climate measures include the usage of biogas to replace fossil fuels and the development of plant-based packaging, for example. The first biogas-fuelled milk collection and distribution trucks hit the road in 2019, and Valio is working towards using cow manure to produce biogas.\n\n\n“In Finland, the production of carbon neutral milk is an achievable goal, as the production methods differ from those elsewhere. For instance, cows are fed mainly grass instead of soy, ” says Pajari.\n\n\nCome discuss the sustainable food business and Valio’s pioneering ingredients and technologies at Food Ingredients Europe in Paris.

Consumers in all age groups are looking for better-for-you food products that support their personal dietary needs and choices. Senior citizens want to age healthily, and chocolate lovers want to eat their chocolate with a better conscience. Valio has the value-adding ingredients and expertise to help food manufacturers meet these needs, whether they are looking to reduce sugar or add cognitive benefits in their food products.\n\n\nDevelop desirable food products for healthy ageing – phospholipids in dairy fat show promise for brain health\n\n\n “Some of the major concerns among the ageing population are losing mobility and memory, and as a result, their independence. Thus, ageing adults are willing to invest in innovations that help them maintain their physical activity and cognitive functions”, says \nMinja Miettinen\n, Senior Research Manager at Valio.\n\n\nValio Eila™ NUTRI F+ lactose free formulated milk protein powder fulfils the key nutritional needs of the elderly. It contains phospholipids that have been associated with improved memory and cognition in several scientific studies.\n\n\n”In ageing adults, numerous clinical trials have shown phospholipid supplementation to restore and maintain cognitive functions, such as memory, learning, concentration, reasoning, language skills and problem solving,” Miettinen says.\n\n\nValio Eila™ NUTRI F+ lactose free formulated milk protein powder gives a full taste and texture, helping Valio’s customers to formulate their products to the taste of older adults. It works in several applications, such as milk powders, special nutrition drinks, dairy drinks, nutritious food and dietary products.\n\n\n30% sugar reduction in chocolate with natural ingredients – no artificial sweeteners required\n\n\nSugar is increasingly overtaking fat and salt as a primary consumer concern. Consumers are constantly looking for ways to reduce their sugar intake, also with products like chocolate.\n\n\n“In their search for healthier options, consumers are not willing to compromise on taste or texture. They also want their products to be clean label, meaning that artificial sweeteners are not a desired option for sugar reduction in chocolate. With Valio’s innovative ingredients, you can reduce sugar naturally without E codes,” says Valio’s Sales Manager \nNiina Gerritsen\n.\n\n\nValio has developed a solution for naturally reducing sugar while giving chocolate that great taste and texture. The amount of total sugar in the chocolate can be reduced by replacing regular milk powder with Valio Eila® PRO skimmed milk powder.\n\n\n“Protein gives ‘30% less sugar’ chocolate a natural rich taste and smooth, creamy texture, so there will be no sacrifices to important product properties,” continues Niina Gerritsen. \n\n\n“Valio has also developed a calculation model to help chocolate manufacturers estimate the cost effects, profit, and end product price when turning regular chocolate into ’30% less sugar’ chocolate.” – Niina Gerritsen, Sales Manager, Valio\n\n\nFor further information visit:\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nWe intend to reset milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. One part of this goal is to reduce our plants’ emissions and energy usage. This summer, we made three important trades to help us reduce our usage of fossil fuels.\n\n\nAdven Oy operates energy facilities at Valio plants all around Finland. This partnership at Seinäjoki is expanding, as we respond to growing energy requirements with a new four-megawatt boiler facility. It will burn wood-based biofuels that are sourced in the nearby regions. In the future, we will produce less of our energy on oil. The new boiler facility will also serve as a replacement for peat. Their contract at Pitäjänmäki is being renewed with a new two-megawatt bioenergy plant being constructed by the juice plant. Our juice plant has, so far, produced energy on natural gas. Its new boiler facility will use biopellets as fuel. \n\n\nSeinäjoki’s CO2 emissions will be cut by roughly 15,000 tonnes and Pitäjänmäki’s by 2,200 tonnes per year. The share of renewable fuels in Valio’s heat production in Finland was nearly 50% in 2018, and over four fifths of the fuels we use are domestic. In the future, the share of renewable fuels we burn in Finland will be closer to 60 percent.\n\n\nIn addition to the boiler facility projects, we will be buying some of our energy as wind power. This share covers roughly a fifth of Valio’s energy usage, which corresponds to that of roughly 2,500 detached houses with electric heating.\n\n\nHot steam, quick cooling \n\n\nValio plants manufacture thousands of tonnes of different products every day. Different production stages require energy, i.e. power and heat. \n\n\n– We use power to run pumps and fans as well as to generate mechanical force – to run our machines. Most of the power is needed for cooling and cold storage. Heat, on the other hand, is used to cook cheeses and drying milk powder with hot steam, for instance. Milk pasteurising requires first heat, and then cold immediately after. When yoghurt production switches from strawberry to banana, the pipes must be washed, and energy is needed to heat the water. Keeping our facilities warm and lit also takes energy, says Energy Manager \nPeter Fabritius\n.\n\n\nRenewable fuels reduce emissions \n\n\nEnergy production generates atmospheric emissions. Emission quality and volume depends on the fuel used in energy production.\n\n\n– One of our larger goals is to stop using fossil fuels altogether. Currently, we still produce energy through burning, but one day, we may be in a situation where all our energy is made on carbon dioxide-free electricity. It could be said we are in a kind of transition. Our juice plant is replacing natural gas and Seinäjoki is putting away oil and peat. In the future, we will strive to reduce peat use by replacing it with biofuels,” Peter continues. \n\n\nBoth projects, at Pitäjänmäki and Seinäjoki, should be complete during 2020.\n\n\nReducing energy use – best way to reduce emissions\n\n\n– In recent years, our work to reduce our energy usage has been good. That is not, however, enough, and we must look for new opportunities to improve our energy efficiency and reduce emissions,” says Peter.\n\n\nValio is included in the Industrial Energy Efficiency Agreement. Our goal is to carry out, during 2017-2020, energy efficiency measures that match four percent of the power and heat consumption in 2015. In 2017 and 2018, we have achieved 2.2 percent of that goal, which means that by keeping up with this progress, the goal will be reached by the end of 2020.\n\n\nWhich solid fuel boiler facility?\n\n\nValio has reduced its use of fossil fuels by commissioning solid fuel boiler facilities at its plants. These solid fuel boilers use domestic solid fuels, such as woodchips, bark and peat, as well as various biomass-based side product fuels, such as sawdust.\n\n\nHeat for Valio plants is produced at solid fuel boiler facilities for eight plants: Oulu, Haapavesi, Lapinlahti, Joensuu, Äänekoski, Seinäjoki, Jyväskylä and Riihimäki. If there’s other industry in the region that uses heat, we work together to source our heat. \n\n\nThe Seinäjoki and Pitäjänmäki heat boilers will also have a steam battery, which is a large tank full of water, where the contents are kept at the boiling point. Changing the pressure in the tank either vaporises or condenses the water, which allows us to change the steam volume quickly. This helps to reduce the use of these solid fuel boilers and thus the use of auxiliary fuels. Seinäjoki and Pitäjänmäki both use gas diesel oil as fuel.\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Vestas Wind Systems A/S\n\n"

This development in packaging is part of a larger goal: the food company wants to cut milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035.\n\n\nPlastic is needed for all food products that keep for a long time, as without the plastic protection, the food would spoil before it even reaches the fridges at home. Packaging has a vitally important task – to prevent a larger environmental hazard: food waste. Plastic becomes a problem if it ends up in nature. \n\n\nEvery one of us can help with our own actions and recycle. It’s now possible to use recycled plastic in food packages. Valio’s delicacy cheeses’ new packages are now made from at least 90% recycled plastic. Over 50% of Mifu slice and Mifu jauhis packages’ plastic is recycled. We intend to ramp up our recycled plastic usage in the future. \n\n\n– Using recycled plastic reduces the plastic industry’s environmental emissions by 40-60 percent compared to making the plastic from fossil oil. Our goal is that in 2020, all Valio sliced cheese packages in Finland are made from at least 50-percent recycled plastic. In the future, roughly 10 percent of all our packaging plastic in Finland will be recycled. That matters a lot when it comes to the environment, says \nJuhana Pilkama,\n package development manager.\n\n\nMany struggle with plastic recycling and don’t know where different types of plastic go. Juhana Pilkama says the most important thing is to recycle the plastic and it isn’t that big of a dead if a package ends up in the wrong bin once in a while.\n\n\n– All recycled plastic is sorted, washed carefully and checked for material. Sorting machines handle possible mistakes, which does come with an additional cost, but that is the lesser of two evils compared to throwing all your plastic in mixed waste. In the future, we intend to clarify the recycling instructions we print on our packages to make recycling easier, says Juhana Pilkama.\n\n\nFrom plant-based packages to recycled plastic\n\n\nValio has worked, over the years, to reduce the amount of plastic and to develop our packaging materials. \n\n\nIn 2015, Valio introduced 100-percent plant-based cartons to Finland’s stores. These cartons are made out of wood, and the thin protective plastic film from the sugarcane industry’s waste, i.e. excess plant parts. The caps are also fully plant-based. \n\n\n– Packages have an environmental impact of only ca. two percent of the entire food product’s environmental load when it comes to carbon dioxide. Despite that, we want to reduce our packaging’s environmental load further. At the same time, we are working with dairy farms, among others, to reduce milk production’s climate emissions, says Pilkama.\n\n\nIn 2019, Valio is discontinuing its use of black-dyed plastic in Finland. Current recycling devices cannot identify the black colour, which means black plastic packages don’t get recycled.\n\n"

Milk is Valio’s largest category of consumer products, and that is why they are a significant addition to the more sustainably produced milk selection.\n\n\nWe source the free-range milk from Valio’s freestall farms, where the cows can move about, eat, and rest at their own pace. Free-range milk is produced on farms all around Finland. Free-range milk is homogenised and pasteurised in the normal way and tastes like any other fresh milk. It is packaged at Valio’s Riihimäki, Jyväskylä, and Oulu dairies. \n\n\n– We want to make free-range milk available to everyone. That is why all of Valio’s familiar milk will come from free-range cows. Regular milk is our largest group of consumer products, and this will allow the milk shelves of Finnish stores to take a significant sustainability leap, says Valio’s Development Manager \nMira Appelqvist\n.\n\n\nSustainability bonus encourages better animal welfare\n\n\nValio is owned by Finnish dairy farmers, and Valio pays out all of its operating profits back to them. Since the beginning of 2018, Valio has paid a sustainability bonus to the dairy farmers who have committed to higher standards of animal welfare. The bonus is currently two cents per litre of milk. \n\n\nOne of the requirements for the sustainability bonus is regular animal healthcare check-ups carried out by a veterinarian. In addition, dairy farms take good care of their animals hooves and provide anaesthesia, pain relief, and sedation during disbudding – the removal of a calf’s growing horns. All the farms that produce free-range milk are naturally within the sustainability bonus programme. \n\n\nThe cows at Valio dairy farms are primarily grass fed, with supplements of domestic grains and turnip rape and rapeseed. The cows do not eat soy or GMO feed. The milk produced in Finland is always free of antibiotics. The cows are never given antibiotics as a preventive measure, but only as prescribed by a veterinarian. \n\n\n– Animal welfare consists of many concrete actions the farms take every day. We believe that free-range milk will become the new norm.\n \nSustainable milk production is not an option; it’s a condition for existence and a requirement of our operation, both ethically and economically. We will also continue to do development work with the farms. About two-thirds of Valio Group’s cows live in freestall barns, and that number continues to grow, says Appelqvist. \n\n"

We produce Finnish food that is safe and in an ethical and sustainable manner,” says Chairman of the Board Mikko Heikkinen. \n\n\n“During the first part of the year we have worked with the owner administration and personnel to define new co-operative’s future direction, targets and concrete activities. The highest possible producer price is one of the key goals of the new Maitosuomi. We will cost effectively offer dairy farm entrepreneurs services that will help in farm development and services they hope to get from the co-operative,” notes CEO Ilpo Lukkarinen notes. \n\n\nValio’s biggest shareholder \n\n\nThe Osuuskunta Maitosuomi co-operative is Valio’s biggest shareholder. The co-operative holds 42.7% of Valio’s shares, and it supplies about half of Valio’s raw milk intake. The milk is collected from a wide area, as shown on the map below. \n\n\nOf the 23 milk-producer members of the Valio Supervisory Board, 10 are from Osuuskunta Maitosuomi. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board, dairy farm entrepreneur \nEsa Kotala\n from Lapua, is a member of the Maitosuomi Board of Directors.

With Valio’s pure Nordic dairy ingredients and latest innovation, food manufacturers can add the benefits of phospholipids on cognitive health and create desirable functional food products for healthy ageing. Experience Valio at Food Ingredients Asia in Bangkok, Thailand, 11 - 13 September 2019\n\n\nAs good nutrition has a scientifically proven link to healthy ageing, the expanding elderly population and their wellbeing provides great potential for the food industry. With the right innovations supporting healthy ageing with nutrition, the food industry can make their products desirable for ageing adults, just as the beauty and personal care industry has done.\n\n\n“Out of all industries, I believe that the food and nutrition industries have perhaps the most significant means to ensure healthy ageing. As consumers, older adults could be described as foodies with emphasis on healthiness. We make about 200 food related choices every day, so there is plenty of opportunity to nudge older adults towards better food choices”, says Dr \nMinja Miettinen, \nSenior Research Manager, Research and Innovations at Valio.\n\n\nDairy fat has been associated with positive effect on cognition \n \n\n\nThe world’s most innovative dairy company, Valio, has developed a range of value-added powders to help food manufacturers respond to the growing demand of ageing adults. The latest developments in Valio’s tailormade food ingredient solutions are showcased at Food Ingredients Asia in Bangkok.\n\n\n“Valio Eila™ NUTRI F+ lactose free formulated milk protein powder fulfils the key needs of older adults. In addition to containing essential nutrients, it also gives a full taste and texture, helping Valio’s customers to formulate their products. It works in several applications, such as milk powders, special nutrition drinks, dairy drinks, nutritious food and dietary products”, Minja Miettinen says.\n\n\nValio Eila™ NUTRI F+ lactose free formulated milk protein powder was introduced earlier this year at Vitafoods Europe. Especially the health benefits of phospholipids located on the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) raised great interest among food industry professionals.\n\n\n“Dairy fat contains phospholipids that, according to research, are associated with positive effect on brain function in those with mild memory impairment. Phospholipids are the building blocks of brain cell membranes and therefore very important for brain function in all stages of the human lifespan, from babies and toddlers to active adults and seniors”, Miettinen states.\n\n\nValio has successfully adapted its Nobel Prize winning dairy innovation heritage to Asia\n\n\nValio has decades of experience with the Asian food market. For example, Valio’s B to B business with China goes back about 30 years.\n\n\n”Asian consumers appreciate high quality, traceability and safety in food products. They want to know where the product is coming from. This is something we can help food manufacturers with, because the production chain of our milk ingredients is completely transparent. The origin of the raw material can be traced all the way back to an individual dairy farm”, says \nTimo Pajari\n, SVP, Food Solutions Sales at Valio.\n\n\nFor further information visit: \nwww.valio.com\n\n"

This cooperation is intended to trial how this new material works when combined with a traditional food package and to encourage Finns to reduce their food waste.\n\n\nBiocomposite products in food packaging are one step Stora Enso is making towards their goal of replacing fossil materials with renewable solutions. DuraSense™ by Stora Enso bio composites, made of wood fibre, can be used to replace over half of fossil-based plastics and, depending on the product, reduce a product’s carbon footprint by up to 60% compared to conventional plastic.\n\n\n– We were the first in the world to start using fully plant-based one-litre milk cartons in 2015. Last year, we converted all of our 250 million gable-top milk, yoghurt, cream, and sour milk packages to fully plant-based ones. These packages are a part of a larger concept where Valio is aiming towards carbon-neutral milk, i.e. resetting milk’s carbon footprint in 2035. We continue to think about new package innovation possibilities that we could try out and implement, says \nTanja Virtanen-Leppä\n, Head of Packaging Development at Valio.\n\n\nStora Enso continues to develop new replacements for plastic from renewable materials. Biocomposite products have similar properties to conventional plastic ones, and these durable and hygienic reusable lids are dishwasher proof. The wood fibre used brings the strength of wood and a pleasant feel to the biocomposite material.\n\n\nBringing cabin food home in a cooler\n\n\nRoughly six percent of the food Finns buy ends up being thrown away, adding up to 150 million kilos of food waste per year. The packaging – and the lid – is meant to protect the food and help to reduce waste. In this collectible campaign, we intend to distribute 10,000 reusable lids to Finnish homes.\n\n\n– With this pilot project, we want to encourage people to take small concrete actions to prevent food waste. For instance, the leftover crème fraiche sauce for fish, made on a cabin weekend, is now easy to pack away in a cooler with this lid instead of throwing the leftovers away. This new lid can be reused after it’s been washed, says Tanja Virtanen-Leppä.\n\n\nSuomiAreena hosts discussion on packages, food, and climate myths\n\n\nHow young people see climate change, food products, and packaging material was studied in a survey which is related to a Stora Enso and Valio-hosted panel discussion at SuomiAreena Pori, “Feelings or facts? Breaking the climate myths on packaging and food”.\n\n\nJournalist Riku Rantala will lead the panel, which will feature topics such as everyday climate choices for consumers and whether or not consumer decisions are made based on facts or feelings. The panelists are Minister of Agriculture and Forestry \nJari Leppä\n, Demos Helsinki’s \nTuuli Kaskinen\n, Nuorten Agenda 2030’s \nSofia Savonen\n, Valio’s \nJuha Nousiainen\n and Stora Enso’s \nSeppo Parvi\n.

        "text": "\n\nFor Valio, 2018 was variable. The global milk market supply exceeded demand, which reflected in the prices for both Finnish and export sales. We continued to see moderate growth in our turnover, and we launched completely new categories during the year. We continued our sustainability work throughout the supply chain, and we initiated partnerships in various projects, with the goal of resetting milk’s carbon footprint by 2035. From a business perspective, 2019 has been proceeding in the right direction.\n\n\nValio Group’s turnover was €1,734 million (1,709), which means a growth of 1.5 percent compared to the previous year. Net sales in Finland grew by half a percent, and net sales abroad grew by 3 percent. Our milk margin* was €800 million (797) and our milk return** was 38.4 percent per litre (37.9). \n\n\nThe situation on the global milk market, however, remained challenging. Supply exceeded demand, which reflected in the prices for both Finnish and export sales. It was a challenging year for Valio’s owner-entrepreneurs: milk prices fell and the summer was record-setting hot and dry.\n\n\nValio and four other dairies reached a settlement in late 2018 and early 2019 in a compensation process regarding base milk pricing. One-off compensation pay-outs resulting from this process were a burden on Valio’s operational profits. \n\n\n“The greatest challenges arise from the dairy industry’s operating environment. Global milk production continued to grow, and last year we saw that weather conditions can have a significant effect on production conditions, both in Finland and around the world. The feed shortage resulting from the record-dry summer was an additional burden on the farms’ financial situation,” says Valio CEO \nAnnikka Hurme\n.\n\n\nIn the Finnish market, Valio’s turnover grew by roughly half a percent compared to the previous year, which is a good performance in a tight competitive space. This growth was supported by the successful development in our product portfolio as well as a strong supply chain. \n\n\nFrom a renewal and innovation perspective, 2018 was strong. In February 2018, we launched our plant-based Valio Oddlygood® products in Finland and Sweden. In March, Valio returned to the ice cream market with its Valio Jäätelöfabriikki™ premium ice creams after a 14-year break. In summer, we renewed our Valio ProFeel® range of protein products and introduced numerous new protein snacks. Of our more traditional categories, basic milk products continued to along a downward trend, consistent with market trends. \n\n\nOur foreign operations produced a turnover of €669 million (649). Valio’s growth continued especially in Sweden, the Baltics, Russia, and China. \n\n\n“In 2018, our turnover in Sweden grew by 10 percent thanks to added-value products, such as lactose-free products. Our turnover growth in the Chinese market was also strong. Valio remains an unknown brand in China, and it takes time to build recognition and create profitable growth. In Russia and the USA, we are focusing on improving operational profitability. Development in these markets in 2019 has remained along those lines,” says CEO Annikka Hurme. \n\n\nSolving the climate challenge and promoting animal welfare \n\n\nSince the beginning of 2018, we began paying a sustainability bonus of one cent per litre of milk to dairy farmers that commit to, among other things, planned and preventive animal healthcare with a veterinarian.\n\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released in late 2018, brought global warming and the means to mitigate it to the forefront. In October 2018, Valio set an ambitious climate goal: we want to cut milk’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. \n\n\n“We know the climate and environmental impacts of milk production, and we are actively working to reduce them. My vision is that dairy farmers and other agricultural operators can come together and become a part of the solution to climate change and the future food supply. As we work towards reducing milk’s carbon footprint, we also want to introduce new points of view when assessing food production’s climate impacts: the nutrition angle should be considered when looking at the carbon footprint of food,” continues Hurme.\n\n\nProceeding in the right direction\n\n\nThe development of Valio’s business in 2019 has started with a positive trend. Net sales growth early in the year has been fuelled by, among other things, rising milk powder prices in the global market. Valio’s three-year project to improve cost-effectiveness and competitiveness and through them, the milk return, was started in 2018 and is proceeding as planned.\n\n\nValio Group key figures in 2018\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2018\n\n\n2017\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet sales, M€\n\n\n1,734\n\n\n1,708\n\n\n+1.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk margin, M€\n\n\n800\n\n\n797\n\n\n+0.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk return, c/l\n\n\n38.4\n\n\n37.9\n\n\n+1.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk volume, ML\n\n\n1,821\n\n\n1,837\n\n\n-0.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity ratio\n\n\n44%\n\n\n45%\n\n\n-1%-pt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments, M€\n\n\n62\n\n\n98\n\n\n-36.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Net sales less all other costs excluding the price paid to the owners for raw milk, interest on shareholder loans, depreciation according to plan, supplementary payments to the pension fund, pension contribution refunds, and items not included in actual business operations, such as sales gains from sales of business operations, and provisions.

        "text": "\n\nCarbon footprints for food and traffic are a hot topic that touches everyone in Finland. Traffic is the source of a fifth of Finland’s greenhouse emissions, and milk’s share of the emissions hovers around four percent. We are in need of new ways to control climate change. Valio, the food company, and Gasum, the energy company, intend to find solutions to the climate challenge together: cow manure can be used to generate biogas, which can replace fossil fuels used in transportation. This new statement of intent serves to initiate an investigation into an appropriate cooperation model. \n\n\nValio, owned by Finnish dairy farms, wants to reduce its milk chain’s carbon footprint to zero by 2035. This ambitious goal can be reached, especially, in two ways: binding more atmospheric carbon dioxide in grass fields and generating biogas from manure to replace fossil fuels. \n\n\n– It’s great that a larger group of Finns want to make environmentally sustainable choices. Our mission is to find new ways to reduce milk’s environmental effect. Valio is owned by 5,000 Finnish dairy farms with cooperatives in between. Our calculations show that if we used the manure from all our farms to make biogas, the volume would be enough to fuel the farm machinery and Valio’s milk collection trucks. Recycling manure into biogas could, therefore, reduce milk’s carbon footprint by up to 50 percent. This would reduce the use of fossil fuels as well as methane emissions, generated during manure storage and use, says \nJuha Nousiainen\n, Valio’s director for the carbon neutral milk chain. \n\n\nBiogas to reduce traffic emissions \n\n\nFinland produces roughly 15 million tonnes of manure every year, making it an interesting raw material for larger-scale biogas production. Currently, the market has not taken off, as using manure in biogas production is not profitable in Finland. In other Nordic countries, government subsidies make it possible to use manure as both an ingredient for biogas and as recycled fertiliser, enabling a better nutrient cycle.\n\n\n– As the largest biogas producer in the Nordics, working together with Valio is a natural solution for us to create solutions for a circular economy. Gasum invests strongly in growing its gas refuelling station network in Finland and the other Nordics. Biogas production must increase to meet traffic emissions reduction targets. We have worked with Valio before. Valio has recently rolled out its first biogas-fuelled distribution and milk collection trucks. Both trucks run on Gasum’s biogas, which uses, among other things, waste from Valio’s dairies as raw material,” says \nMatti Oksanen\n, Gasum’s director for business development.\n\n\nFinland’s Ministry of Transport and Communications published an action plan in December 2018, outlining the changes in Finland’s transportation towards 100% renewable fuel by 2045. One solution is to increase the share of renewable fuels, such as biogas. At the same time, Finland’s government has set a goal to have 50% of our farms’ manure to be recycled by 2025.\n\n\nBiogas, clean water, and fertiliser\n\n\nThe manner of Valio and Gasum’s cooperation will be detailed over the course of this year. One option is to build a shared biogas plant, or a network of several plants. All the while, Valio and Gasum are continuing to design their shared plant at Nivala, in Finland’s Ostrobothnia region. An investment decision on the Nivala plant has not yet been made, and the project is in the planning stages.\n\n\nIn 2017, Valio was the first in the world to patent a method to turn liquid manure into both clean water and easily transportable, organic-approved phosphorus and nitrogen fertiliser fractions that are easy to spread. The same process allows for producing biogas from dry manure fractions and other milk chain side flows. There are many benefits: using slurry as a fertiliser gets easier, nutrient cycling becomes more efficient, and the runoff of nutrients decreases. The method differs from current separation processes in that it’s possible to remove most of the water from the fertiliser fractions and turning the energy in manure to biogas. Valio has made use of its milk component processing know-how in the manure nutrient separation process.\n\n\nLike black gold – 3 facts of manure and recycling\n\n\n1. Manure energy can replace fossil fuels\n\n\nFinland produces roughly 15 million tonnes of manure every year, the energy in which could be used to make biogas. (Source: Luke Natural Resources Intitute Finland, The Finnish Normative Manure System)\n\n\n2. Dwindling world phosphorus reserves\n\n\nManure, in addition to energy, contains valuable nutrients that plants need: nitrogen and phosphorus. Phosphorus is a mineral that plants need to grow. The world’s reserves of phosphorus are dwindling quickly, which means we need new solutions for mineral recycling, soon. Recycling the phosphorus and nitrogen in manure makes it possible to use fewer chemical fertilisers.\n\n\n3. Manure needs a lot of storage space and field area\n\n\nFrom a farmer’s perspective, liquid manure needs large slurry tanks and wide fields to spread the manure on. If a milk producer wants to expand their farm, i.e. to have more cows, they also need larger fields. Buying new fields, however, makes little business sense, if existing fields can produce a sufficient harvest. Cutting down forests for fields just to spread manure is not environmentally sustainable.\n\n"

The 2019 Sustainable Brand Index survey measured the sustainability of European and Finnish brands.\n\n\nAccording to the consumers participating in the survey, the best things about Valio are its Finnish milk, its attention to animal welfare, and its environmentally friendly packaging. Finns also see Valio as a good performer in terms of reducing climate impacts. \n\n\n“The IPPC climate report published in autumn 2018 brought an unprecedented intensity to the discussion around the environmental impacts of food production. At Valio, we take the climate change challenge seriously and we want to be part of the solution. Last year we set a big target: we are aiming for a carbon-neutral milk chain by 2035,” says CEO \nAnnikka Hurme\n.\n\n\nOne concrete action on the way towards a carbon-neutral milk chain is plant-based packaging. All of Valio’s gable-top milk, buttermilk, cream and yogurt cartons sold in Finland are made from 100 percent plant-based, renewable material.\n\n\n“It’s great to see that environmentally friendly packaging is important to Finns. The climate impact of plant-based packaging is 58 percent less compared to traditional cartons. The annual climate impact is equivalent to driving a car more than 10,000 times from Helsinki to Kittilä, Lapland and back,” Hurme continues.\n\n\nThe survey results also indicate that animal welfare and the Finnish origin of milk were important to Finns. About 5,000 Finnish milk producers own Valio through co-operatives.\n\n\n“We pay all the profit from our operations to the dairy farms in the price of milk. When you choose Valio’s cheese or yogurt in the store, you can be sure that the money is going to the producer, i.e. the owners of Valio. And we can also thank them for the fact that Finnish milk is the world’s purest and the animals are the world’s healthiest. For example, antibiotics are never given to the animals without reason. A year ago we started paying a responsibility bonus to the farms that commit more to animal welfare than required by law. About 93 per cent of all the milk already comes from these farms.\n\n\nSustainability is long-term work and there are also challenges associated with it. A couple of weeks ago the NGO Finnwatch published a report in which it investigated the rights of employees in Thai plants supplying pineapple and thickeners to Valio. The grievances that were discovered had not been revealed in plant audits.\n\n\n“We need more know-how in managing human rights risks in so-called risk countries. This year we will conduct a human rights assessment of our supply chain. We will also define in more detail our own practices to ensure responsibility. It’s great that civic organizations are spurring and helping companies in sustainability efforts.”\n\n\nHow the Sustainable Brand Index study was conducted\n\n\nSustainable Brand Index is Europe’s biggest brand sustainability study, and it has been conducted annually since 2011.\n\n\n“The goal of the study is to spread and increase information about sustainability. A significant dairy industry player is expected to take responsibility for the impacts of its operations. Valio is perceived as taking care of that in an exemplary manner,” says \nErik Elvingsson Hedén\n, founder of the Sustainable Brand Index.\n\n\nThe 2019 study surveyed a total of about 50,000 people: 10,300 from Finland, 7,400 from Denmark, 18,600 from Sweden, 7,700 from Norway, and 6,000 from the Netherlands. The target group of the survey was 16−70 year olds in each country. The sample represents the demographics of each country. The surveys were conducted in January-March 2019.\n\n"

We believe that Finnish and foreign guests alike will be pleased with this themed suite,” says Hotel Klaus K general manager \nHanna Kiuru\n.\n\n\nThe Sweet Suite opens on 1 March, and it will close at the end of December. There is room for two in the Sweet Suite.\n\n\nNew surprising flavours on the store shelves\n\n\nLast year, Valio returned to the Finnish ice cream shelves after a 14-year break. The ice cream factory, at the Oulu plant, makes the only entirely Finnish, entirely lactose free family of ice creams. Ice cream lovers have been very excited for the comeback. This spring, Valio is introducing four new surprising and delicious flavours. The new flavours are a rich \ndreamy chocolate\n, tart and sweet \nlemon curd\n, exotic \npassion fruit-coconut\n, and juicy \napple-oat pie\n. They will be available in Finland in our familiar striped tubs, and are guaranteed to be delicious.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nThe recently released FinRavinto 2017 survey shows that Finns’ salt intake is still too large, with the sodium contributing to a risk of high blood pressure. According to the survey, 86% of women and almost all men, 98%, exceed the daily recommended sodium intake. Valio’s patented Valio ValSa® milk salt makes it possible to reduce the sodium content in food without compromising on taste. Last year, almost 7 million kilos of low-salt Valio ValSa® products were sold in Finland.\n\n\nRoughly half of the sodium chloride, i.e. regular table salt, is “hidden” in food products: roughly a quarter of it in meat products and another quarter in grain products. Cheeses and spreadables also need salt for them to have a good taste and texture.\n\n\nValio’s solution to reduce salt in cheeses and spreadables is Valio ValSa® milk salt, which is made of the minerals that occur naturally in milk, and which contains almost 80% less sodium compared to regular table salt. The first Valio ValSa® milk salt products were introduced in 2016. We have released low-salt versions of Valio Polar® and Valio Oltermanni® cheeses with Valio ValSa® milk salt, as well as a new product release in February 2019, Valio Salaneuvos® ValSa® gouda cheese. Valio Oivariini® spreads are also available in low-salt Valio ValSa® options.\n\n\nValio wants to tackle Finns’ excess salt intakes \n\n\nIn 2018, Valio created a Nutrition Agreement to help Finns reduce their excess sodium intake. With nutrition agreements, Finland is helping to implement the UN’s sustainable development strategy, among other things. Corporate and community commitments are a part of the nation-level work.\n\n\nWe have committed to growing our low-salt Valio ValSa® product selection. Our goal is to sell 7 million kilos per year of ValSa® products by at least 2020. We got close to this target as soon as 2018: we sold almost 6.85 million kilos of Valio ValSa® products, almost all of them in Finland.We will provide increased nutritional details in Valio Test Kitchen recipes, which helps consumers make low-salt recipe choices. All Valio Test Kitchen recipes now show the amount of salt per 100 grams. We are developing our search functions to make low-salt recipes easier to find at our Finnish webpage.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nIn February 2019, our new milk collection truck that runs on LBG, liquefied biogas, will be rolling out to gather the milk we use to make Valio products. Using biogas as fuel helps to reduce the carbon footprint of milk collection, and it has a strong link to the idea of a circular economy: waste fractions of Valio’s production process are used to make biogas. The LBG milk collection truck will run the Southern Finland routes.\n\n\nClimate change picks up speed, and food companies are in search of solution for slowing it down. Valio has an ambitious goal: we are aiming for a carbon-neutral milk. Improving our logistics and, for example, using biogas is one concrete action we can take to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\n\n“We had been looking into using a biogas-fuelled milk collection truck for a few years already. Now, vehicle technology and the biogas distribution network has developed to the point that we wanted to start using a biogas-fuelled truck. I am happy and proud that buyers of for example Valio Luomu™ organic products can now do even more good. Small acts add up to a large effect,” says Valio category manager \nMirva Tollet\n.\n\n\nValio is a company owned by some 5000 Finnish dairy farmers. In addition to Valio Luomu™ milk, the truck will also be used to collect other Valio milk. Our intent is to use the vehicle as much as possible, up to 24/7, to make its emission-reducing effect in the logistics chain as great as possible, as well as to collect as much experience on using the vehicle as possible. Regular milk and Valio Luomu™ milk are collected on different collection runs.\n\n\nA safe thermos\n\n\nUsing biogas in heavy vehicles has only become possible recently, as the vehicles have been made efficient enough and a single tank can provide enough range.\n\n\n“Valio’s new Volvo LBG 460 milk collection truck is basically the same to drive and is as efficient as a traditional diesel fuel truck. Some drivers and vehicle purchase decision-makers tend to still hold on to their old image of the first gas vehicles, which still had quite a lot of room for development,” says Volvo Finland sales director \nReino Manninen\n.\n\n\nBiogas also raises plenty of questions on safety – all unfounded. Liquefied biogas (LBG) is pumped into an insulated tank. In normal air pressure, LBG liquefies at -162 degrees. If any gas is released during refuelling or when the vehicle is running, it vaporises and mixes with the air very quickly.\n\n\n“LBG has a very high flashpoint, i.e. the temperature it needs to ignite. The truck’s fuel tank is double-shelled and insulated with an underpressurised vacuum layer, like a thermos flask, to keep the gas at a cold temperature. In case the gas warms up and the tank pressure rises, the tank’s automatics releases the gas into the air in a controlled manner to lower the pressure. The temperature may rise if, for example, the vehicle is unused for a long time. In Valio’s case, the vehicle will be used efficiently, nearly 24/7, to gain the largest benefits from its features,” says Manninen.\n\n\nCircular economy at its best\n\n\nValio intends to gather experiences on such a milk collection truck’s energy efficiency and general usage, and to make a decision on the future based on that. Its future plans are also influenced by how the heavy vehicle biogas distribution network, i.e. refuelling stations, expands.\n\n\n“It’s great that Valio is making use of environmentally friendly biogas, which is made of biowaste, as fuel, and thus reducing the emissions of its cargo logistics. The production of renewable biogas is circular economy at its best, and it allows us to reuse biowaste efficiently. 40 percent of Finland’s traffic emissions are caused by heavy traffic, and that is why companies’ cargo logistics are under pressure to reduce emissions. One lorry engine, depending on its size, corresponds to roughly 40-50 personal cars when it comes to annual emissions. To reduce traffic emissions, we need pioneers like Valio,” says Gasum sales manager \nJuha-Matti Koskinen\n.\n\n\n“Our processes, too, generate waste fractions that, while not useful to us, can be used to make biogas. This means we provide Gasum with raw material, which is then made into the LBG we fuel the truck with. We have other biogas-fuelled vehicles, such as a distribution truck and some company cars for staff. Reducing the carbon footprint of our whole logistics operation is significant to our goal, which is a carbon-neutral milk production chain, as our vehicles run a lot of mileage in transporting the milk and the products we make out of it,” says Valio development manager \nPetteri Tahvanainen\n.\n\n\nThe LGB milk collection truck runs its route in the hands of the transportation company Autoyhtymä Roimola. The company has committed to environmentally friendly operations long-term. The drivers have been rewarded on economic manner of driving since 2001.  The company has also been awarded transportation company of they year by the Finnish Transportation and Logistics Organization (SKAL) for their environmental work.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nIn 2015, Valio was the first company in the world to start using plant-based cartons and announced a lofty goal: by the end of 2018, all of its gable top milk, sour milk, cream and yoghurt cartons sold in Finland will be fully plant-based. We have now achieved this goal, and these cartons are currently being made of fully plant-based materials. Next, Valio intends to expand the use of plant-based packaging in other products.\n\n\nPlant-based packages reduce our carbon footprint\n\n\nValio sells in Finland roughly 250 million gable top milk, sour milk, cream and yoghurt cartons every year. This year, every single one of them will be fully plant-based. CO2 emissions, compared to traditional materials, are reduced by 3,140 tonnes every year. That is enough to drive the trip from Helsinki to Kittilä, Lapland and back over 10,000 times, says Valio’s packaging development manager \nTanja Virtanen-Leppä\n.\n\n\nThe cartons’ cardboard and plastic parts are all made of plant-based materials. Cartons are made of wood-fibre cardboard. The renewable plastic used to make the caps and to line the carton is made from plant ethanol, which is a side flow of the sugarcane industry. There needs to be a thin layer of plastic to make sure the liquid stays fresh in the carton.\n\n\nValio aiming for carbon-neutral milk\n\n\nThe package’s share of the product’s environmental effect is surprisingly small. A majority of a dairy product’s carbon footprint is created in primary milk production, that is, before the milk collection truck arrives at the dairy. That is why Valio is \naiming towards a carbon-neutral milk\n. In the spring of 2019, Valio and the Baltic Sea Action Group will begin to train dairy farms in carbon farming: the farms will be taught new ways to bind carbon to the soil and to share existing good farming practices. The energy in cow manure can also be used to replace fossil fuels in the future.\n\n\nAiming for reduced total environmental effect\n\n\nValio aims towards making all of its gable top cartons out of renewable plant-based material. We are currently studying ways to make plant-based juice cartons. Juice cartons use a thin layer of special plastic that protects the vitamin C in the juice.\n\n\n“Development of the juice carton plastic layer has gone well, and we will be able to produce nearly 100% plant-based juice cartons as soon as this year. Our goal is to be smart about reducing our total environmental effect: the right kinds of packages protect the products and prevent food waste, and plant-based packaging reduces the products’ carbon footprint. We are also increasing our use of recycled raw material, and encourage consumers to recycle our packaging correctly.”\n\n\n“Valio’s packaging development is guided strongly by the fact that people want our packages to be fully plant-based. There are also packages on the market that are only partially plant-based, with part of the raw material being fossil. In these solutions, the calculated share of plant-based material is based on the mass balance of the raw materials, not 100% renewable materials: the plastic is made with fossil oil and only a small part of the raw material is actually plant-based,” concludes Virtanen-Leppä.\n\n\nIn addition to Valio Finland, Valio Sweden has already changed its yoghurt cartons to plant-based packages. The next step is to move also other milk products into plant-based packaging.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nExactly one year ago, Valio began to pay a sustainability bonus to dairy farmers that commit to various measures to promote animal welfare, such as planned healthcare for the animals. The goal is for all of Valio’s dairy farms to be included in the sustainability bonus and planned animal healthcare by 2020. Currently, 96 percent of our milk is sourced from farms that participate in planned healthcare. Planned and preventive healthcare is the basis of animal health, and therefore also that of Valio’s business operations.\n\n\nValio’s historical Quality and Production method reforms have been in place for one year this January. What we’ve been calling animal welfare reforms are most importantly aimed at providing the cows a better, healthier life. Planned healthcare has an effect on not only animal welfare, but also the farm’s economy: the healthier the cows, the better they produce milk.\n\n\n– Providing a better life for our animals through planned healthcare means that a vet visits a farm at least once per year and records their findings in the national cow health register, Naseva. There is a 200-point list that the vet goes through, which includes various animal care, health, welfare and barn conditions, as well as tracking cow morbidity and medication needs. Visits always include the creation of an action plan, says Valio’s primary production director \nJuha Nousiainen\n.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of 2018, Valio has paid an extra one cent per litre to entrepreneurs who have proven themselves committed to sustainable dairy production. As an example, a 60-head herd would earn a farm an extra 6,000 euros per year. To receive the sustainability bonus, each dairy farm must, in addition to implementing preventive healthcare, also implement regular monitoring of the condition of the hooves. They must also ensure that pain relief and sedatives are given to calves as part of disbudding. This has long been standard practice at most of our farms. Our production manuals state that every new barn must be built as a free-stall, where the cows can move about, be milked, and eat at their own pace. Finland’s milk production is peculiar for the fact that we do not feed our cows soy, using instead farm-grown grass feed.\n\n\nValio is a company owned by roughly 5,000 Finnish dairy farms, and 82% of those farms are currently receiving the sustainability bonus. One year ago, that number was 76%.\n\n\nFinnish cows among the healthiest in the EU\n\n\nFinnish cows are among the healthiest in the EU, and antibiotics are only used as prescribed by a veterinarian to treat illness, never as a preventive measure. Animal health and welfare are also directly connected to human welfare: the less we medicate our production animals, the better we can keep the global threat of antibiotics resistance in check, to keep antibiotics-resistant bacteria strains from forming. In Finland, antibiotics are used at a significantly lower rate than what is usual in the EU.\n\n\nTo support its dairy farmers in their daily work, Valio has two of its own veterinarians and roughly 20 advisors that work for the cooperatives, as well as a laboratory service that produces analysed data on feed nutrient content and milk purity, among other things. Valio and its cooperatives also hold a variety of training courses for dairy farmers. In addition, Valio is actively involved in research and development programmes that aim for better animal health and welfare. \n\n\nAnimal welfare linked to climate change\n\n\nValio also aims to meet the challenge of climate change. This is why, in October 2018, we announced that we are aiming for a carbon-neutral milk chain.\n\n\n– We acknowledge the environmental effects of milk production, and work actively to reduce them. What we are aiming for is for our carbon footprint to be zero in the future, says Juha Nousiainen.\n\n\nOne part of the carbon-neutral milk chain is the Power Cow project, which aims specifically towards improving cow and calf health and welfare. This work combines improving animal welfare: and reducing the environmental effects of milk production: the better the cows are doing and the longer they live, the less they generate methane per litre of milk produced.\n\n\nOur climate work also includes courses in what is called carbon farming. Valio will begin to train dairy farmers in carbon farming in the spring of 2019 with the Baltic Sea Action Group. Two hundred farms will be included in the first phase.\n\n\n– Fields and farmers can be a part of the solution to climate change. A healthy soil can bind and store atmospheric carbon. It’s efficient at holding nutrients, reducing nitrogen and phosphorus spills into water systems, among other things. Combined with the right kind of field cultivation and a circular economy, cattle raising may also be a sustainable part in fighting climate change. There are already many farms that make use of carbon farming practices, says Juha Nousiainen.\n\n"

These new export permits allow Valio to export its powdered infant formulas, manufactured at the Lapinlahti plant, and ready-to-feed liquid infant formula, made at the Turenki plant, to China.  \n\n\nValio has exported milk powders and demineralised Valio Demi™ whey powders for industrial use in China since the 1990s. Finnish milk powders have been used, among other things, as ingredients for local baby food. In 2017, Valio started to also export consumer-packaged milk powder to China.  \n\n\n\n“We want to strengthen our position in China as a trusted supplier of high-quality industrial ingredients. At the same time, we are building a consumer product market. Naturally, we are looking to generate new revenue, but profitable growth does not happen in the blink of an eye. Valio is, as of yet, an unknown brand in China, so there is a lot to do. In the first phase, we are engaging in negotiations with potential customers,” says \nJussi Mattsson\n, Valio’s category SVP. \n\n \n\n\nThe new permits open up China’s growing infant formula market to Valio.  \n\n \n\n\n“Competition for consumer attention between dairies is heated. In China, online stores, markets and baby supply store shelves are filled with choices from dozens of manufacturers.

In 2014, a new powder plant was opened at Lapinlahti, meeting the most stringent of quality criteria. In the 2010s, China has been revamping its food legislation and permit procedures for imported food products.

The co-operatives will continue to operate in their current form until 31 August 2019, starting together as the new Osuuskunta Maitosuomi on 1 September 2019.\n\n\nOsuuskunta ItäMaito has a little over 1500 dairy farmer entrepreneur members and Osuuskunta Maitosuomi a little over 1000. ItäMaito’s raw milk intake was around 519 million litres in 2017 and Maitosuomi’s some 364 million. For the transition period, seven members of Osuuskunta ItäMaito and five from Osuuskunta Maitosuomi have been elected to the Board of Directors of the new co-operative. The following have been elected to the Board of Directors for the transition period, from ItäMaito: \nHannu Gröhn, Nurmes; Arto Heikkinen, Pyhäntä; Mikko Heikkinen, Lapinlahti; Jarno Kämäräinen, Kiuruvesi; Petri Natunen, Joroinen; Jari Puhakka, Ilomantsi; Satu Pulkka, Vieremä\n and from Maitosuomi: \nEsa Kotala, Lapua; Mats Broända, Kruunupyy; Hannu Hokkanen, Kangasniemi; Antti Saari, Lapua; Kyösti Anttila, Kurikka\n.\n\n\nThe transitional Board of Directors will meet for the first time before the end of 2018 to start building the operations and organisation of the new co-operative and ensure the goals set for the merger are met.\n\n\nThe highest power of decision in the new co-operative will be exercised by its members in electing the delegates, and the first election will be held in autumn 2019. In accordance with the co-operative principles and Valio’s owner strategy, all members of the new co-operative have one vote in a delegate election. Also, dairy farmer entrepreneurs are paid a raw milk price set by its composition and production, independent of the size or location of the farm.\n\n\nRenewed conditions for operational development\n\n\nThe new co-operative will be domiciled in Lapinlahti. The merger will enable the further development of services for the dairy farmer entrepreneurs and greater resource efficiency. The co-operative’s official languages will be Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n“The goal of the merger is to develop operations and allocate resources to respond even better to the co-operative’s needs, and promote the operating conditions for dairy farming. The number of dairy farmer entrepreneurs in Finland has been falling by 5–7% per year for some considerable time now, which also reduces the number of members in the milk producer co-operatives. The merger will enable us to enhance for example our advisory and expert services, and secure the future of services offered by the co-operative. Also a large unit promotes specialisation. All services can be provided in Finnish and Swedish,” says \nPaula Kaleva\n, Chair of the delegates of the current Osuuskunta Maitosuomi co-operative.\n\n\n“The new co-operative’s Lapinlahti domicile puts it close to the heart of the newly combined operating area, and Valio’s cheese and powder plants’ modern premises in Lapinlahti are ideal for the new co-operative’s personnel. Most of the clerical staff will work and be based in different parts of the co-operative’s territory. The name Maitosuomi (‘Milk Finland’) aptly describes the new operating area spanning a large part of the best milk production regions in Finland,” says \nPetri Natunen\n, Chair of the delegates of ItäMaito.\n\n\nThe new co-operative will be Valio’s largest single shareholder\n\n\nThe new co-operative will be Valio’s largest single shareholder (42.7%) and supply around 50% of the raw milk taken in by Valio.

        "text": "\n\nOver the years, Valio has tested equipment that runs on various environmentally-friendly fuels. Now, Valio is taking the next step towards environmentally friendly transportation solutions. Valio’s first bio-gas distribution truck took to the Helsinki region’s roads in September.\n\n\nThe idea to use a bio-gas truck traces its roots back to Valio people’s ideas on the circular economy: we should be able to recycle the waste created in milk production. And since we have been converting waste from Valio dairies to bio gas, why not try an environmentally friendly bio-gas distribution truck to deliver Valio products. Using renewable, Finnish bio gas allows Valio to reduce up to 85% of the fossil carbon dioxide emissions during the fuel’s life cycle.\n\n\n– We want to try out new, environmentally friendly fuels. One of the raw materials for the bio gas is, among others, side streams from Valio dairies – waste that cannot be used as food. Anything that decomposes and is biodegradable is suitable as a raw material for bio gas. Our goal is to create a perfect circulation where we can use all the side flows of food production effectively. That’s what a circular economy is at its best, says Valio logistics manager \nMika Jyrkönen\n.\n\n\nValio participates in bio gas production by providing Finnish energy company Gasum with, among others, its plant waste. Instead of the waste being deposited at a land fill or burned, bio gas plants use them biomethanisation processes to generate bio gas. This gas can, then, be used as fuel in transportation or as an industrial energy source. Because bio gas is formed through biomethanised organic waste, it is a renewable, Finnish fuel.\n\n\n– It’s great that Finland’s top dairy company can make use of its own waste and therefore reduce its own emissions. Bio gas is financially competitive is comparison to other bio fuels. Roughly 40 percent of Finland’s traffic emissions come from heavy transportation, which is why it is under pressure to reduce those emissions, says Gasum sales manager \nJuha-Matti Koskinen\n.\n\n\nValio’s new bio-gas distribution truck is a step towards low-emission milk transportation. Using bio gas in milk transportation also supports Finnish Government and EU goals on increasing amounts of gas cars and emissions reduction. One central EU goal is that, by 2025, emissions from new heavy vehicles should be 15 percent lower compared to 2019 levels. Bio gas traffic use can help reduce the greenhouse gas emissions during the fuel’s life cycle by up to 85 percent.\n\n\nValio’s first bio-gas distribution truck delivers products from the Helsinki Main Warehouse to stores in the Helsinki region. The Helsinki region was picked as the first usage area thanks to its good gas distribution network. Distribution route efficiency is important to Valio, which is why gas station locations must be taken into account in planning the bio gas truck’s routes. Efficient logistics translates into reduced emissions.\n\n\n– We have high expectations of bio gas in transportation use. In the beginning, we want to test the operational reliability and the costs of a bio-gas distribution truck. Our findings will show how we move forward. We don’t want to end our experiments here, and we plan to test a milk collection truck that runs on liquefied natural gas (LNB). Some Valio people have also been already using bio gas cars as company cars for a while now, says Valio’s Mika Jyrkönen.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nFinland has a strong cheese culture, and our cheeses have gained accolades around the world. We consume a lot of cheese, and in recent years, we’ve started to explore the variety of different cheese types. This fall, the highlight is on the effect of ripening time on the taste of cheese.  \n\n\nFinns eat an average of 27 kilos of cheese per year. Apart from traditional favourite Edam cheese, there is a rising interest in other cheese types: ripened cheddar and gouda are selling more than ever before. Finns have recently primed their taste buds to try the more different cheeses.\n\n\n– There is a significant amount of option alongside the traditionally favourite cheeses in Finland. That has been a kick-starter for consumers to try new kinds of cheese. It’s been a joy to see that Finns are increasingly eager to explore different tastes. To respond to this rising demand, our cheesemakers have been focusing their efforts on our gourmet cheese selection, says cheese category manager \nHarri Rantala\n.\n\n\nValio aims to advance Finnish cheese culture by introducing new products to the market and by developing new ways to make cheese. As an example, Valio Luomu™ cream cheese has, this autumn, received a more ripened variant.\n\n \n\n\nLong tradition in Finnish cheesemaking\n\n\nFinland is a strong cheesemaking region alongside the traditional cheese countries, and Finnish cheese is also attractive around the world: Valio exports high-quality cheeses to various European countries as well as to Japan and North America, where Valio cheeses can be found at deli counters.\n\n\nFinnish cheese is strong because of its pure, high-quality local milk and our traditional cheesemaking expertise we have built for over a hundred years.\n\n\n– Valio’s hard cheeses have a short list of ingredients: milk, cultures, and salt. In addition to these, cheesemaking requires rennet. Valio does not use preservatives in its cheeses, says Valio’s leading technology expert, \nMatti Kärki\n, revealing the reason why the cheeses also meet the needs of the consumers that value naturalness.\n\n\nSimple ingredients are a food business trend that does its part in setting a requirement of high ingredient quality. The raw milk that is used in making cheese has an effect on both the taste and the quality of the cheese.\n\n\nValio milk is among the purest in the world, and it contains no antibiotic residue. Finnish cows are only prescribed antibiotics by certified veterinarians, and milk quality is subjected to multiple rounds of testing at the farm, the milk truck and at the dairy. Its clean and safe ingredients are one of Valio’s largest selling points around the world.\n\n\nRising trend in cheese ripeness comparison\n\n\nEverybody knows that wine gets better with age – a well-known example of the connection between age and taste. The same principle applies to cheese. By changing ripening periods, the same cheese may gain any kind of nuance in taste.\n\n\n– Cheese ripening is very precise. When we make the finest, most mature cheeses, just letting it ripen is not enough; ripening a cheese is an active, if slow, process, says Matti Kärki.\n\n\nCultures have an integral role in cheese ripening. We use primary and secondary cultures that provide the typical cheese holes, have an effect on its taste and create the deeper aromas during ripening. This, however, requires, that the cultures have the correct conditions.\n\n\n– Of course, the exact ripening process for our matured cheeses is a closely guarded secret, says Matti Kärki.\n\n\nThe ripening period has the largest effect on taste. An easy rule of thumb is that the longer the ripening period, the stronger the cheese.\n\n\nYou could create a cheese plate of differently aged cheeses to study the effect. For instance, it’s easy to taste the difference between Valio’s different emmental cheeses. Valio’s blue-label emmental has been matured for three months, the red-label for six months, and finally, the black-label Mustaleima™ has been matured for nine months. It’s usually best to start with the mildest cheeses, proceeding from the younger cheeses to the older ones.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nThe record warm summer sparked a discussion about climate change and the future of food production in Finland and Europe. The environmental impacts of meat and milk production are at the core of the discussion because ruminating cows create methane, a greenhouse gas. The current means to reduce methane have been exhausted so we need new climate actions. Farmers in the future may become solvers of climate change, if fields can be turned into better carbon sinks. Better grass harvests mean also better profitability for dairy farms. As a responsible food company, Valio aims for a carbon-neutral milk chain.\n\n\nFor decades, Valio Group has done tremendous work to reduce the environmental impacts of methane emissions from ruminants and eutrophication caused by phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers, and has worked to increase resource efficiency in the production of one kilo of meat and milk. For example, the amount of methane has been cut in half over fifty years as a result of dairy farms’ good efforts and animal breeding: cow health and nutrition has improved, and when a cow produces more milk, also the emissions per milk liter are reduced.\n\n\nFields and soil as carbon sinks\n\n\nIndeed, a lot has already been accomplished, but the methods currently being used to reduce methane emissions have been exhausted. The milk chain’s share of Finland’s greenhouse gas emissions has remained at about 3-4 percent throughout the 2000s. So what can we do next?\n\n\n“Merely reducing emissions is not enough if we want to achieve the Paris climate agreement target to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius. We must also be able to remove emissions from the atmosphere. The importance of forests as carbon sinks has long been known. Now it is time to start setting our sights on soil. Fields may become significant carbon sinks in the future,” says \nJuha Nousiainen\n, Director of Farm Services at Valio.\n\n\nHealthy soil can absorb and store atmospheric carbon. Additionally, it efficiently retains nutrients so that nitrogen and phosphorus, e.g., do not runoff into waterways. That is why cattle farming combined with the right kind of field crops and the circular economy can be a solution to climate change mitigation. A carbon-neutral milk chain means that the production chain is able to absorb more carbon than it releases into the atmosphere.\n\n\n“Healthy soil absorbs twice as much atmospheric carbon than plants do. The soil’s organic matter, for example plant debris and microbes, plays a critical role in storage. Factors such as crop rotation that is too limited, tillage intensity and unilateral use of artificial fertilizers may weaken soil condition. Farmers can improve carbon absorption with, e.g., crop rotation, by increasing the spectrum of grass species, and by keeping the fields green for as much of the year as possible, practices that are already being applied at many farms,” Juha continues.\n\n\nSavings and profitability for farms\n\n\nIf realized, a carbon-neutral milk chain brings savings and cost-efficiency for the producer and improves the profitability of all Finnish agriculture.\n\n\n“I have talked with many Valio dairy farm entrepreneurs, and I know that a big number of farmers are very eager to solve environmental problems. We at Valio have received requests to engage in more collaboration, e.g., to preserve biodiversity. We will be working with the cooperatives to offer new kinds of information and support for the environmental work of farms: best practices on carbon absorption into soil, increasing biodiversity, reducing the methane emissions of cows, and putting manure back into the nutrient cycle. Many of the methods are simple and don’t generate any extra costs for the farms. On the contrary, diverse and healthy fields also improve crops and can be one way to improve the profitability of farms,” Juha reflects.\n\n\nIt is still too early to stay when a carbon-neutral milk chain will be achieved. The goal is within the next few decades.\n\n\n“We are starting with a few dozen voluntary farms. There are already enthusiastic pilot farms that can be found for the cultivated grass groups, for example. We believe that in the upcoming years there might be hundreds of voluntary dairy farms participating in the climate work.”\n\n\nMore than 90% of the environmental impact, or carbon footprint, of a dairy product is created in primary production – in other words, before the milk truck drives through the gates of the dairy. That is why the work to be done at farms plays such a big role in achieving the carbon-neutral milk chain. There is also a lot to do in the later phases of the milk chain: improving the energy efficiency of production plants, optimizing transportation routes, reducing the carbon footprint of packaging, and reducing wastage at the plants are examples of concrete actions Valio has already taken.\n\n\nCollaboration with research groups and environmental organizations\n\n\nNew research data is also needed to achieve a carbon-neutral milk chain.\n\n\n“There has been little research on the emissions of agricultural countries and their ability to remove emissions from the atmosphere. We are collaborating with leading research groups and environmental organizations, exploring solutions for soil and grass carbon sinks in particular. The research data provides us with new tools also for farms,” says Valio’s \nAnu Kaukovirta-Norja\n, Senior Vice President, Research and Technology.\n\n\nValio is creating currently the so-called ProLanta (“ProManure”) ecosystem and has invited various players to join in.\n\n\n“We want to efficiently capture the nitrogen and phosphorus contained in manure and return it to the nutrient cycle. Valio has developed a technology that can separate phosphorus and nitrogen from the manure into fertilizer fractions. At the same time, clean water and biogas, which can replace fossil fuels, are created. The manure from the Valio Group’s 5,300 farms would create enough biogas for use by all the farm equipment as well as Valio’s collection and delivery trucks. And there would even be some left for the plants to use,” Anu adds.\n\n\nA major step for Finnish agriculture?\n\n\nNobel Laureate A.I. Virtanen headed Valio’s laboratory for close to 50 years. Under his leadership, Finnish agriculture overall made a major advancement with the introduction of AIV fodder to preserve feed for cows over the winter without compromising quality. Prior to that, cows didn’t really produce milk during winter − the feed was of such poor quality. Today’s agriculture likely wouldn’t exist in Finland without A.I. Virtanen’s innovations and Valio’s persistent work to implement them into practical use.\n\n\nNow it is time to take what may be an equally big step forward. Good practices can spread also across Finnish borders, just as AIV fodder did.\n\n"

The Chairman of the Board of each outgoing co-operative signed the merger agreement on Wednesday, 29 August 2018 in Helsinki. The final decision on the merger will be made by the co-operatives’ delegate meetings this autumn.\n\n\nThe new co-operative will be named Osuuskunta Maitosuomi, domiciled in Lapinlahti. The merger will enable the further development of services for dairy farmer entrepreneurs and greater resource efficiency.\n\n\n“The number of dairy farmer entrepreneurs in Finland has been falling by 5–7% each year for some considerable time now, which also cuts the number of members in the milk producer co-operatives. The merger will enable us to enhance our operations and secure the future of services offered by the co-operative. Advisory and expert services will be more effective together and serve the entrepreneurs more efficiently. And a large unit promotes specialisation. All services can be provided in Finnish and Swedish,” says \nEsa Kotala\n, Chairman of the Board of Osuuskunta Maitosuomi.\n\n\nThe new co-operative will be Valio’s largest single shareholder with 20 849 shares (42.7% of the total 48 861), leading also for raw milk intake at around 900 million litres per year.\n\n\nOsuuskunta Maitosuomi has a little over 1100 dairy farmer entrepreneur members and Osuuskunta ItäMaito just under 1600. Osuuskunta Maitosuomi’s raw milk volume intake was around 364 million litres in 2017 and ItäMaito’s some 519 million. Together, the co-operatives supply nearly half of the raw milk volume taken in by Valio. Osuuskunta ItäMaito’s offices are based in Lapinlahti and those of Osuuskunta Maitosuomi in Seinäjoki. Of the 23 dairy farmer members on Valio’s Supervisory Board, four represent Osuuskunta Maitosuomi while ItäMaito has six.\n\n\n“The new co-operative’s Lapinlahti domicile puts it close to the heart of the combined operating area, which extends from Ostrobothnia to North Karelia and from Kainuu to Central Finland. Lapinlahti’s current cheese and powder plants’ modern premises are ideal for the new co-operative’s personnel. Most of the staff will be serving the entire territory. The new co-operative is being christened Maitosuomi (‘Milk Finland’), which aptly describes its new operating area stretching across a large part of the best milk production regions in Finland,” says \nMikko Heikkinen\n, Chairman of the Board of ItäMaito.\n\n\nThe new co-operative is set to start operating at the beginning of September 2019, in which case the first election of delegates will be held in autumn 2019. In the meantime, a Board of Directors will be elected in late 2018 for the transition period to ready the merged co-operative for operation and ensure the goals set for the merger will be met.\n\n\n“Our goal is to further develop operations and focus personnel performance and resources so we can respond to the needs of the dairy farmer entrepreneurs even more effectively, and promote the prerequisites of their livelihood in the best possible way. The merger targets the cost-efficient development of our services,” say \nIlpo Lukkarinen\n, Managing Director of Osuuskunta ItäMaito and \nReima Luomala\n, Managing Director of Osuuskunta Maitosuomi.\n\n\nThe new co-operative will be administered similarly to the current co-operatives: all members of the new body have one vote in the election of delegates.

With the new manure process patented by Valio, nutrients can be recirculated more efficiently. At the same time Valio wants to create a manure ecosystem, i.e. a network in which the different players together pursue local and centralized solutions for manure processing. If successful, the network’s impacts on the environment would be significant.\n\n\nEvery year production animals in Finland generate about 20 million tons of manure; the nutrients contained in the manure are underutilized. Valio is the first in the world to patent a process in 2017 to produce clean water and phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizer fractions from liquid manure. The benefits are many: the use of liquid manure as a fertilizer would become easier, nutrient cycling would become more efficient, and nutrient runoff would decrease significantly. Now Valio wants to invite farms, technology players, gas and nutrient sector companies, researchers, investors and authorities to join in the manure ecosystem. \n\n\n“As a responsible milk processor, we want to find new solutions to efficiently return nitrogen and phosphorus to the nutrient cycle. Collaboration is the only way to achieve the government’s circular economy target: by 2025, 50 percent of farm-based manure must be processed. An ecosystem involving many kinds of players and expertise is needed alongside the technology solution developed by Valio. The network would surely find also new, decentralized solutions for processing manure. Geographically, Finland is long and wide, so that’s why decentralized solutions would enable more a sustainable implementation platform. If realized, a manure ecosystem would have significant environmental impacts,” says Juha Nousiainen, Director of Farm Services at Valio. \n\n\nThe most important elements for milk production are a good grass harvest and the feed made from it, and cows that convert grass feed into food. However, there are also challenges associated with feed production: \n\n\n“In its current form, liquid manure is both a useful fertilizer and a problem. It is problematic because the storing and spreading of the watery manure requires a lot of storage and arable land area, and as the number of cows increases it may be difficult to find enough acreage to spread the liquid manure. Additionally, the nutrient content of liquid manure is quite low, and the utilization rate of nitrogen, in particular, is low. There are also significant costs involved with spreading, and the heavy equipment used burdens and compresses the fields. Better circulation is also needed because the world’s phosphorus resources are limited,” Nousiainen explains.\n\n\nThe process developed by Valio produces clean water as well as organic phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizer fractions that are easy to spread on the ground. Biogas production from the dry fractions of manure and other milk chain effluents can also be integrated into the process. The biogas generated in the process can be utilized as transport fuel, for example. The process differs from the separation methods currently in use in that a large portion of the water is removed from the manure fractions and the energy contained in the manure can be utilized as biogas. In the phosphorus separation process, Valio utilizes its expertise in the processing of milk components.\n\n\n“Valio Group’s 5,500 dairy farms already have good examples of utilizing manure locally. For example, dairy farmer entrepreneur Heikki Junttila from Nivala, Western Finland, has produced biogas at the Heusala farm since the turn of the century. This is a great example of a dairy farm’s own environmental work. Now we are inviting all interested players to join in the manure ecosystem,” Nousiainen concludes.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nConsumers have been enthusiastically trying out new ingredients in food preparation during the past few years. The popularity of meat substitute products in particular has grown. Valio MiFU® – a Finnish food innovation made from milk – can be used in recipes that call for meat or chicken. On Wednesday, June 20, Valio MiFU® strips won the World Dairy Innovation Awards competition in the Best New Brand/Business category. \n\n\nTwo years ago Valio introduced a new protein source for food preparation in home kitchens: Valio MiFU® products made from Finnish milk. The strips became available on store shelves last autumn. The jury appreciated Valio’s creativity in using dairy as a meat alternative as well as the innovativeness and interesting manufacturing process of Valio MiFU products.\n\n\n“Quite a lot is demanded from even a simple home-cooked dish: it should be healthy, quick to prepare, and tasty to the whole family. People get tired of making the same meals and are looking for variety. We had these issues in mind when we set out to develop Mifu. Valio MiFU® products inspire people to try something new,” says Business Manager \nPia Järvinen\n.\n\n\nThe strips have been available in stores in Sweden since the beginning of the year. Valio will showcase the products in September at SIAL Paris, a big international food exhibition.\n\n\n“The food expertise in Finland is truly outstanding. Valio MiFU® is a great example of how milk can be turned into many forms and uses. Valio’s product development legacy goes back more than a century. Not many people know that Nobel Laureate A.I. Virtanen headed Valio’s laboratory for close to 50 years,” Järvinen gives a backdrop to the award.\n\n\nThe World Dairy Innovation Awards have now been held for the 12th time. The respected international food-sector competition is organized by FoodBev Media, and this year a total of 150 entries around the world participated in it. The awards were given out in Warsaw.  \n\n\nThe story of Valio MiFU® products started when Valio’s internal innovation team was assigned the task of coming up with a new way to use the casein protein found in milk. The starting point for product development was to find alternative protein sources to meat. Many challenges had to be overcome before the successful end result.\n\n\n“One of the most important tasks of product development was developing a texture that could be pan-fried. Creating a good texture and mouth feel, however, wasn’t enough: the product also had to remain the same when heated and be easy to use in food preparation,” recalls Researcher Niko Nurmi from Valio. \n\n\nShelf life and a product that would make everyday cooking nutritional and tasty for the whole family were also a focus.\n\n\n“The nutritional values we aimed for were a high protein and a low fat content – without compromising good taste,” Nurmi continues.\n\n\nDeveloping a new product requires much more than just a product development desk and a laboratory.\n\n\nValio MiFU® strips are made at Valio’s Vantaa plant.  \n\n\n“Perfecting the product took time and was the collaborative effort of product developers, researchers and production professionals. It’s always an especially exciting moment when the product moves from your own desk to a bigger scale. And naturally we always test the products with consumers. They provide the most important feedback,” Nurmi concludes.\n\n\nWhat are Valio \nMiFU® strips?\n\n\nMifu can be used in recipes that call for meat or chicken; it doesn’t require pre-preparation or pre-cooking. Mifu is best when used in hot meals as is or after browning in a frying pan. Mifu maintains its texture and mouth feel well when heated. Valio MiFU® strips are also rich in protein (24 g per 100 g). The products are free of lactose, gluten, eggs and yeast, so they are suitable for many special diets. Valio MiFU® products are made from milk and milk protein, so they are not suitable for a vegan diet.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nPäivi Myllärinen, Valio’s principal scientist and Doctor of Food Sciences, has received a significant innovation award for women from the Finnish Parliament. Myllärinen received the award for her pioneering research and development of dairy technology. By combining nature’s own biological processes and process technology, she has created completely new food technology methods and products based on them.\n\n\nThe goal of the Parliament’s innovation award is to highlight the importance of innovations and the significant role women have in the economic growth generated by innovations in the fields of technology and the economy. Speaker of Parliament\n Paula Risikko\n presented the award to Päivi Myllärinen on 1 June 2018, the anniversary of universal and equal suffrage in Finland.\n\n\n“Päivi Myllärinen’s contribution to Valio’s product development and to the Finnish food industry overall has been remarkable. She has been the innovator behind 17 dairy industry-related patents or patent applications, and Valio has generated over 100 million euros of new net sales based on her innovations,” says \nTuomas Salusjärvi\n, Executive Vice President, Product Groups and R&D.\n\n\n“Valio’s goal is to offer consumers products that not only support health and wellbeing but also have an excellent taste and mouth-feel. We are known for our unique product development expertise, the foundation of which is the research work conducted by Nobel Laureate A.I. Virtanen, who headed Valio’s laboratories for close to 50 years. Päivi is continuing this more than century-long legacy. Thanks to Päivi’s innovations, we can produce products like full-flavoured snacks that are high in protein and low in fat,” Salusjärvi continues.\n\n\nA curious mind put her on a research path\n\n\nMyllärinen graduated as Doctor of Food Sciences in 2004. She has worked for 20 years in grain technology and for the last 13 years in dairy technology. Her passionate interest in food ingredients and their properties hasn’t diminished over the 33 years.\n\n\n“It is extremely intriguing how something as wonderful as rye bread can be created from such simple ingredients like rye flour and water. The same goes with milk: how it can be transformed from a liquid into various forms ranging from yoghurt to cheese,” says \nPäivi Myllärinen\n.\n\n\n“At Valio I’ve been able to do ambitious research work together with the world’s best food industry experts. Innovations are never created at the desk of a single researcher; an innovation always has a team behind it, a team of our own researchers and others – for instance production experts from our plants. It has also been really wonderful to be part of several international research projects that have brought together businesses, universities and research organizations to advance the food industry,” Myllärinen sums up her career.\n\n\nMyllärinen’s research efforts have focused on how raw materials react when combined with various production methods and other ingredients. The research has resulted in unique products, like Valio PROfeel® protein products, Valio MiFU® milk protein products, and oat-based Valio Oddlygood® snacks and drinks.\n\n\nMore courage for women\n\n\nMyllärinen is flattered by and proud of the award.\n\n\n“This is great recognition for the entire sector because it signals that food industry research and product development work is seen as a significant matter also for society,” Myllärinen says.\n\n\nWomen hold a good position in the Finnish scientific world, Myllärinen notes. She hopes her fellow researchers would have more courage to take on bigger challenges and more demanding roles.\n\n\n“The challenging and interesting nature of research work stems from the fact that, at the outset, you never know what the end result will be. That’s why there will always be challenges and also failures. However, you can’t let them discourage you, you have to just keep moving towards the goal with determination,” Myllärinen encourages.\n\n\nAward for a scientifically significant innovation\n\n\nThe award is worth EUR 110,000 and it will be granted in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The award is granted to a woman or a group of women for a scientifically significant innovation in the technology or economic sector.\n\n\nThe Technology Academy Finland foundation has arranged the award process in practice. The Chancellery Commission of the Parliament has selected the winner from the group of the best candidates.\n\n\nVideo interview with Päivi Myllärinen\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio, the most innovative dairy and food company from Finland, today held an unveiling ceremony for its China head office in Shanghai. The newly established head office will focus on serving the Chinese market. Besides the Ingredient business units, Valio China has also established the new business units of Retail and Food Service. By carrying on the century-honoured Finnish heritage in innovation and high quality, Valio China will stand side-by-side with Chinese consumers to create a better life together.\n\n\nDuring the 30+ years since entering the Chinese market in 1986, Valio has witnessed the high-speed growth of the Chinese economy and has worked with partners to drive the improvement of China’s dairy industry. Shanghai’s favourable location, the capability of global resource allocation and the economic concentration of headquarters can help Valio build its global sales, marketing and service networks, and reinforce its overall competitiveness and influence both in the Chinese market and globally.\n\n\n“We’re really excited to inaugurate our China head office in Jing’an, Shanghai,” said Annikka Hurme, CEO of Valio Ltd. “In 2008 Valio created a dedicated office in Shanghai. Today we officially established our China head office. Right now, there is good momentum in the Chinese economy; we do hope that our China head office can write the next chapter for Valio in China.”\n\n\nAccording to Euromonitor International, China is a huge dairy market and it continues to grow. China’s dairy market size was 376 billion RMB in 2017. The market is expected to reach 484 billion RMB by 2022.\n\n\nZhou Hai Ying, Deputy Head of the People’s Government of Shanghai’s Jing’an District, said: “There is an old Chinese saying, ‘Eating is even more important than the Emperor’. With the increases in consumption, I am confident Valio products will become ever more popular among Chinese consumers. We hope that Valio, a globally renowned food and dairy company, can continue to offer fresh and pure products of high quality, achieved through strong control of the quality chain from pasture to table, and continue to provide delicious and healthy food to consumers, as well as to boast better and faster development in the Chinese market.”\n\n\n “China is a very important market for Finnish companies, and we see a lot of potential in China,” said Finland’s Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Jari Leppä. “The strengths of the Finnish dairy sector include the high quality of products and the health and welfare of production animals. For example, our use of antibiotics is very minimal. The hygiene, safety and product traceability of the food chain are our competitive advantages.”\n\n\nBringing the genuine Finnish goodness to the China market\n\n\nValio’s connection with China dates back to 1986 when Valio collaborated with the Ministry of Agriculture of China to help develop China’s dairy industry by providing milk production knowledge training in Finland and Beijing. Valio DEMI™ demineralized whey powders entered the China market in 1990. Thanks to Valio’s world-leading demineralization process and the pure quality from Finland, the product was widely used to produce infant formulas as well as chocolates and ice creams. Since then, Valio has been driving its growth in China by establishing a sales, marketing and service system to provide professional and innovative solutions for the premium dairy ingredients market in addition to demineralized whey powders and skimmed milk powders. Furthermore, Valio opened flagship stores on e-commerce platforms, such as JD.com and Tmall.com in 2017 to provide consumers with high-quality enjoyment from Finland.\n\n\n“Valio’s ability to win the trust of the Chinese market in a relatively short period of time is mainly because of our sustainable business model that ensures that our products are fresh, safe and traceable,” said Xiao Lu, Managing Director of Valio China. Valio strictly manages and controls every process – from cow-raising to the collection, transportation, quality inspection, processing and warehousing of raw milk – to ensure the quality and safety of the entire supply chain, from farm to plant.\n\n\n“Right now, China is undergoing a new round of consumption upgrading, and natural, healthy and environmentally sustainable foods are gaining popularity among consumers. Valio will continue enriching its product categories in China to meet the various needs of Chinese consumers. For example, Valio’s unsalted butter, made using the pure, high-quality milk from Finland through a traditional fermenting process, was awarded “Best of Class” at the World Championship Cheese Contest in 2018. It will undoubtedly be a pleasing addition for food enthusiasts in China,” Xiao Lu added. Valio will also step up efforts to promote the development and application of its patented Eila® lactose-free technology.\n\n\nR\nead More about \nValio’s Products in China\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk Powders\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about \nValio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Valio products on \nJD.com\n and \nTmall.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow \nValio\n on Weibo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch “ValioFinland” and follow us on WeChat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to \nValio’s Corporate RSS feed\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The dairy and food company received the recognition for the fifth consecutive year in the Nordic’s largest brand study on sustainability. Issues of particular importance to consumers included securing the vitality of rural Finland and the dairy farm livelihood, locally produced food, and animal wellbeing.\n\n\nThe Sustainable Brand Index 2018 surveyed consumers for their views on the sustainability of prominent companies and brands in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, and the Netherlands. Valio was ranked first among the 164 brands evaluated in Finland and received a higher score than in the previous year.\n\n\n“The world’s highest quality milk, healthy animals, and safe and premium quality products are a matter of honor to us. This award is a wonderful recognition to the 5,500 dairy farm entrepreneurs around Finland and to all Valio employees for the long-term sustainability work we do every day,” says \nKristiina Kiviharju\n, Valio’s Senior Vice President of Quality & Sustainability.\n\n\nAccording to the survey, eco-friendly packaging, the reduction of food loss, and healthy products are important factors for Finnish consumers when talking about sustainable food production.\n\n\n“For Valio, sustainability means concrete actions from the dairy farm to the store shelf. In 2017 we implemented the historically most extensive quality and production reform to improve animal wellbeing. We started paying a responsibility bonus to the farms that commit to preventive healthcare for cows, among other things. Another good example of a sustainability action is the world’s first entirely plant-based packaging. The renewable material doesn’t use any oil whatsoever as a plastic raw material, so the carbon footprint is 58 percent smaller compared to a container made from fossil raw materials,” says Kiviharju.\n\n\nAccording to the survey, a total of 54 percent of Finns are of the opinion that Valio does good work in environmental and climate issues, and 52 percent believe that the company performs well in social issues.\n\n\nHow was the study conducted?\n\n\nSustainable Brand Index is the Nordic’s largest brand study on sustainability, and it has been conducted annually since 2011. The goal of the survey is to distribute and increase information related to sustainability. In the 2018 survey, some 40,000 respondents were interviewed in the Nordic countries: 16,600 in Sweden,  6,200 in Norway, 7,000 in Denmark, and 9,600 in Finland.

        "text": "\n\nFor Valio, 2017 was a good year from a business development perspective: net sales increased by 4.3 percent, and Valio was able to pay the co-operatives a steady milk price despite the challenging market situation. Valio introduced more than 100 new products and maintained a positive growth trend in added value products both in Finland and in exports. In addition to existing export markets, we also entered new consumer markets. Other significant events of the year included the commissioning of the world’s most modern snack plant in Riihimäki and the historically most extensive quality and production reforms to improve animal welfare.\n\n\nIn 2017 Valio was voted the most responsible company in Finland for the fourth consecutive year in Scandinavia’s biggest Sustainable Brand Index™. In addition to the Board of Director’s Report and Financial Statements that were published today, Valio will publish its Sustainability Report 2017 in English later in April.\n\n\nChallenging milk market situation\n\n\nValio Group net sales in 2017 were EUR 1,708 million (EUR 1,638 million in 2016). Domestic net sales remained unchanged and international net sales increased by 12.4 percent. Valio continued its growth particularly in Sweden, the Baltics, Russia and China. The milk margin** was EUR 797 million (772 million) and the milk return* was 37.9 cents per liter. The milk market situation remained challenging despite the overall economic growth.\n\n\n“The biggest challenges come from the dairy industry’s operating environment. The imbalance of the global markets continues, and the growth in milk production is expected to outpace the demand for dairy products,” says Valio’s CEO \nAnnikka Hurme\n.\n\n\nThe very low price of milk powder and the drop in the price of industrial butter from the peak prices at the beginning of the year chipped away at the milk return, i.e. Valio’s profitability. The situation is expected to continue because of the high volume of EU milk powder intervention stocks. The cause of the development is the EU and global overproduction of milk. About 35−40 percent of Valio’s raw milk is made into powder and butter, so changes to productivity have a direct impact on Valio’s profitability. The overall downward trend in the consumption of dairy products in Finnish markets is increasing the channeling of raw milk into these industrial products. Therefore, it is important to grow the exports from Finland.\n\n\n“Accessing new export markets and achieving profitable growth requires us to invest in personnel and in marketing in the upcoming years. Consequently, we are constantly looking for new ways to do things more agilely and efficiently. There are no shortcuts to accessing new export markets; it’s a matter of going through the regulatory permit processes as well as long-term building of recognition,” Hurme notes.\n\n\nThe goal is to pay the EU’s highest and most stable milk price \n\n\nValio is owned by 5,500 Valio dairy farmer entrepreneurs through 16 co-operatives. Valio’s goal is to pay its owner co-ops the most stable and predictable milk price possible and the highest price in the EU. The price paid by Valio has remained higher than the average EU price throughout the 21st century. The average price paid for raw milk last year was 39.0 cents per liter (38.1). It was decided to pay 0.5 cents per liter in after payments for 2017. The total raw milk price paid to owners was nine million euros more than in the previous year.\n\n\n“All business earnings, less expenses and funds allocated for business development, are paid to the owner entrepreneurs. Additionally, keep in mind that the investments of our owners help us to create premium products and future favorites,” Hurme says. \n\n\nResponsibility bonus to improve animal welfare\n\n\nIn 2017 Valio implemented the most extensive quality and production reform in its history. Since January 2018 Valio has paid a one-cent-per-liter responsibility bonus to entrepreneurs who commit to improving animal welfare. The goal is that all dairy farms are within the sphere of the new agreement by 2020. In March 2018 about 90 percent of the milk liters received by Valio were sourced from farms within the sphere of the responsibility bonus.\n\n\nThe responsibility bonus requires that the dairy farm commits to, e.g., planned animal healthcare, regular hoof check-ups and hoof treatment, and to the use of anesthetic, pain control medication and sedation during disbudding. Additionally, every new barn must be a free-stall barn.\n\n\n100 years of nutrition innovations \n\n\n2017 marked the 100th anniversary of the establishment of Valio’s first research laboratory. Chemist Artturi Ilmari Virtanen started his life’s work at the Valio laboratory in 1919 and headed the laboratory for nearly 50 years. \n\n\nValio’s newest innovations, like ValSa® milk salt and snacks with reduced sugar, are responses to the global nutrition challenges. Valio updated its salt and sugar reduction targets in 2017. The targets are part of Valio’s nutritional commitment, which is contributing to the UN’s sustainable development goals.\n\n\nLaunched on the markets in September 2016, Valio MiFU® friable cooking crumbs have made milk protein a main source of protein at meal time. The product family expanded with the introduction of Valio MiFU® strips in September 2017.\n\n\nAt the end of the year Valio announced the market launch of the totally plant-based Valio Oddlygood® product family. The new products are a response to a major trend in consumer behavior: Finnish consumers want variety and inspiring options in their food choices. In the new product category Valio is tapping into its decades of product development and technology expertise.\n\n\nWorld’s most modern snack plant in Riihimäki\n\n\nCommissioned in September 2017, the Riihimäki R2 snack plant is the largest single investment in Valio’s history. The plant’s annual production capacity is 120 million kilograms and it employs some 70 people.\n\n\nThe dairy’s energy, logistics and water consumption solutions reduce losses and conserve natural resources, and over three-quarters of the thermal energy used at the plant is produced from renewable fuels. The world’s most modern heat recovery system brings an energy savings of 30% compared to the old Riihimäki plant.\n\n\nMost responsible company in Finland \n\n\nIn 2017 Valio was voted the most responsible company in Finland for the fourth consecutive year in Scandinavia’s biggest Sustainable Brand Index™. Valio examined the views of its different stakeholders groups in its own sustainability survey in December 2017. In addition to more than 1,000 consumers, Valio’s personnel and owner entrepreneurs, customers, partners, and social leaders took part in the survey.  \n\n\nThe majority of all respondent groups considered Valio as a company that operates responsibly. The themes considered as the most important for responsible operations were Valio’s economic impacts, i.e. employment and retention of the Finnish dairy industry, product safety, procurement transparency, supply reliability, and animal welfare.\n\n\n“We will continue working on these and other issues.

There were 30 leading butter brands from around the world participating in the unsalted butter class. Butter is one of Valio’s most important export products and a premium product enjoyed around the world: Valio butter is exported to more than 30 countries and is a product favoured by French bakeries, among others.\n\n\nValio received a remarkable score of 99.70 points in the World Championship Cheese Contest. Placing second was Fonterra from New Zealand, and the third place went to Isigny Sainte Mere from France. Valio butter’s winning attributes are its superior flavor, consistent texture and high quality which are ensured by the expertise of Valio’s master butter makers. Valio butter is also a 100-percent natural product with no additives.\n\n\n“Valio’s customers and consumers around the world appreciate not only the outstanding taste of Valio butter, but also the fact that it is made from pure, high-quality Finnish milk. Our butter-making craftsmanship spans more than a century, and all Valio butter is made by the professionals at the Seinäjoki dairy from milk that comes from Valio dairy farms,” says Senior Vice President \nAnnamari Lammi\n.\n\n\nValio’s story as a company started back in 1905 when Finnish milk producers wanted to start exporting the world’s best butter.\n\n\nThe Rolls Royce of butter, say the French\n\n\nValio exports butter especially for use by industrial customers in Europe and Asia; Valio butter is used by bakeries, the processed food industry, ice cream makers, and dairies. Butter made from Finnish, high-quality milk can be tasted in croissants baked by some of the leading bakeries in France, for example. \n\n\n“Our French customers truly value the premium quality of our butter, and, in fact, they often say that our product is the Rolls Royce of butter,” Lammi says.\n\n\nIn butter exports, Valio is currently sharpening its focus on international consumer markets.\n\n\n“Valio butter has been a consumer favourite for decades in, e.g., the Caucasus region, and we export Valio butter to other places as well, such as Sweden. In 2017 we established a strong foothold on the consumer markets in Poland, where Valio butter can already be found in most of the international chains,” Lammi notes.\n\n\nFinns are accustomed to mostly using salted butter, but virtually everywhere else in the world it is unsalted butter that is the most popular product in household kitchens and in the food industry. In addition to the Valio brand, Valio butter is sold under the Finlandia® brand in the United States. Finlandia Cheese is Valio’s subsidiary operating in the United States.\n\n\nIn addition to butter, the World Championship Cheese Contest 2018 awarded cheeses and yoghurts.\n\n\nWorld Championship Cheese Contest 2018:\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio is taking a step towards more environmentally friendly milk production by entirely discontinuing the use of soy in feed for cattle and young cattle. Giving up soy is a concrete action in Valio’s extensive responsibility programme. A soy-free milk production chain is also an excellent competitive factor in international markets: an increasing number of customers expect dairy companies to actively reduce the environmental impacts of dairy products.\n\n\nValio’s Board has decided that, effective 1 March 2018, Valio dairy farms will discontinue the use of soy in cattle and young cattle feed. So far, small amounts of soy have been used for feeding young cattle. Soy has already been replaced with other protein sources in the biggest Finnish feed producers’ supplementary feed for dairy cows. Our goal is that also the feed for young cattle is soy-free by 28 February 2019.\n\n\nGoing soy-free is part of the extensive responsibility programme \n\n\nDiscontinuing soy is one part of Valio’s extensive responsibility programme. For Valio, responsibility translates to practical actions, and removing soy from the feed chain is one concrete action for a better life. In practice, soy will be discontinued on dairy farms as of March. Having a one-year transition period ensures that dairy farm entrepreneurs can use up any of the soy-containing feed that they already have in stock or that has already been ordered.\n\n\n“Soy is the most important protein feed for animals globally. At the same time, it is also the most important source of plant protein for people. Part of Valio’s responsibility approach includes that we don’t feed animals food that is suitable for human consumption,” says \nJuha Nousiainen\n, Director of Farm Services at Valio.\n\n\nThe fundamentals related to cattle nutrition also support discontinuing the use of soy in feed. Studies indicate that in grass silage-based feeding, rapeseed is a better supplementary protein feed for dairy cattle than soy.(Source: Vanhatalo etc. 2004, Shingfield etc. 2003). Compared to milk production in the rest of Europe, soy is of minor nutritional importance for Finnish cows.\n\n\nA soy-free milk chain is a competitive advantage internationally\n\n\nA soy-free milk production chain is an excellent added value factor for Valio in international milk markets, where customers are also compelling dairy companies to reduce the environmental impacts of dairy products. The environmental impacts of South American soy production are unsustainable. The clear cutting and cultivation of rainforests and savannah areas cause greenhouse gas emissions that accelerate climate change. (Source: WWF)\n\n\nThe soy-free feed chain requirement applies to the dairy stock calves, heifers and dairy cattle of the Valio Group’s dairy farms. Likewise, animals that are part of the Valio Group milk production chain but raised outside the dairy farms, e.g. on heifer farms, must be fed soy-free feed.\n\n\nThe soy-free requirement doesn’t apply to other production animals at Valio dairy farms, animals like suckler cows, beef cattle or feeder calves. Prior soy-feeding doesn’t prevent the buying or selling of the animals as long as feed containing soy is no longer given to animals in the milk production chain on Valio Group dairy farms. The use of soy is allowed in the cattle feeding experiments of research institutes.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio invited specialist teams from around the world to enter a hackathon competition to find solutions for making use of the methane cows produce, and to reduce methane emissions. There were seven competing teams. The winners, Methanovores, solved the Methane Challenge on the barn level by collecting the methane from indoor air and using it on-site.\n\n\nFinnish dairy farms have reduced their methane emissions by nearly 50 percent in the past 25 years, mostly thanks to selective breeding, but an estimated 2.5 percent of Finnish greenhouse gas emissions come from dairy production (Source: Statistics Finland, 2016). As a significant milk producer Valio wants to find new solutions that could allow us to reduce the amount of methane gas that is generated, and to make use of it as efficiently as possible.\n\n\nThe hackathon, held on 7-9th February, received applications from 28 teams all around the world. Seven teams made the cut. Some of the participants hailed from as far away as Brazil and India, and even the Finnish teams had plenty of international specialist members. The teams were varied networks of corporate, university, and research and expert organisation members. Methanovores, the winners, were made up of members from the Natural Resources Institute and the Technical Research Centre.\n\n\n“Some of the entries were quick to implement, and some required additional work. In choosing our winner, we focused on a solution that could be implemented quickly and without too much additional work. Cooperation is a strength in science as well – by combining the best parts of various entries, we may be able to find more solutions to reduce methane emissions and to make use of existing gas,” says judge panel chair and Valio EVP \nMika Koskinen\n.\n\n\n“We are happy and surprised for this victory. Our idea is to filter out the methane from the barn’s air conditioning and then refine it further, for example to produce energy,” says \nCyril Bajamundi\n, a member of the winning team.\n\n\nMethanovores, the winning team, included Tapani Kivinen, Ismo Heimonen, Cyril Bajamundi, Juha-Pekka Pitkänen and Leo Ojala. They were awarded a cash prize.\n\n\nOther teams had ideas that dealt with methane emission measurement and monitoring as well as reducing emissions with different diets for the animals.\n\n\n“This Hackathon was an interesting and productive way to find solutions for using and reducing methane emissions. We managed to attract just the right kind of teams. We are very happy with the results, and have various ideas that we can look at for further development,” says \nVirpi Jonson\n, Valio’s Innovation Manager responsible for the competition.\n\n\nThree-day Crunch\n\n\nValio partnered with hackathon organising experts at Ultrahack for the competition. The three-day competition was held at Valio’s Research & Development Center in Pitäjänmäki, Helsinki. Competitors had the help of six mentors from Valio’s farm services as well as from the research and development organisation. The mentors helped spar and guide the teams, and provided clarity business potential of their ideas.\n\n\n“The Hackathon required a strong effort from us, the organisers, so that we could create the right kind of assignment where the ideas are guided in the right direction. My task as a mentor was to increase the competitors’ understanding of our wide, resource-effective milk production organisation and the role in that context,” says \nJuha Nousiainen\n Senior Vice President, Farm Services.\n\n\nTeams were allowed to practice pitching their ideas under professional guidance. In pitching, the team must sell their idea to the judges’ panel in five minutes, requiring an effective and impressive performance.\n\n\nThe  ideas were put under the eye of a five-person panel, consisting of bio-economy and clean tech Development Director Jarmo Heinonen from Business Finland, Deputy Director General Liisa Saarenmaa from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Global Eco Solutions CEO Kari Larjava, and Valio EVP Mika Koskinen and Vesa Kaunisto, Chairman of the Board\n\n\nMore information:\n\n\nRelease 05 December 2017>\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio has announced its nutrition agreement for improving the health and wellbeing of consumers. The ambitious targets for reducing salt and sugar content in Valio’s products by 2020 are part of our sustainability programme and continued efforts to improve public health.\n\n\nThe United Nations’ sustainable development goals for 2016–2030 aim at eradicating poverty and safeguarding wellbeing in environmentally sustainable ways. Alongside contributions from nation-states, however, the efforts of companies are also needed. Valio’s nutrition agreement is part of Finland’s Agenda2030 programme.\n\n\nValio’s nutrition agreement helps consumers to reduce their use of sugar and salt, and makes it easier to make low-salt choices or recipes. From 2015–2020, Valio will double the number of snack products it makes that are unflavoured, sugar-free, and with 20–50% less sugar than before. The goal for reducing salt content is to sell seven million kilos of Valio ValSa® reduced-salt products annually by 2020. Valio will also provide details of the amount of salt in all Valio recipes by 2020.\n\n\n“Our commitment is linked in particular to two UN goals: ensuring an adequate standard of food and nutrition, and improving health and wellbeing. Meeting these goals is essential, since the world’s population is projected to grow to as much as 9 billion by 2030. In Valio’s sustainability programme, we have committed to concrete actions that respond to global nutrition challenges. Innovations to improve health and wellbeing have been part of Valio already for decades, since Nobel Prize winner A.I. Virtanen was heading the Valio laboratory”, says Senior Vice President of Research and Technology \nAnu Kaukovirta-Norja\n.\n\n\n“Valio website contains one of Finland’s most popular recipe collections. The site receives an average of 1.1 million visitors a month, and has around 4,000 recipes. This gives us a great opportunity, and also a responsibility, to help consumers to make smart food choices. People need healthy products, especially in their everyday lives. Of course, a few treats now and then are also part of overall wellbeing”, Kaukovirta-Norja adds.\n\n\nConsumers want products to be both healthy and tasty\n\n\nOn average, the intake of sugar per person in Finland is almost twice the recommended daily amount of 50 grams. Among the consequences of this is an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The average consumption level of salt is also often well above the recommended limit, despite it being common knowledge that excessive salt use contributes to cardiovascular disease.\n\n\n“Great-tasting food is extremely important to people, and is not something they want to give up on. The role of Valio and other food companies is to rethink how salt and sugar can be reduced without compromising on taste”, says Kaukovirta-Norja.\n\n\nValio’s low-salt product range, cheeses and spreads with Valio ValSa®, was launched in 2016, and by the end of 2017 almost four million kilograms of these products were sold. The goal is to bring the annual sale of Valio ValSa® products up to seven million kilos by 2020.\n\n\n“Thanks to the milk salt innovation on which the Valio ValSa® products are based, we have reduced salt use in cheeses and spreads by up to 50 percent, without affecting taste. The taste of milk salt comes from the minerals naturally contained in whey and will soon bring more, completely new products with Valio ValSa® milk salt to the market. Valio’s commitment to reducing salt use will result in the reduction of salt use by about 38,000 kg annually, which is about six million teaspoons of salt”, Kaukovirta-Norja adds.\n\n\nA major part of Valio’s R&D work at the moment focuses on reducing sugar. In 2015 Valio made 84 different snack products that met Valio’s commitment of reducing sugar content, and by 2017 Valio had increased that number to 136. The target for 2020 is to have 168 low-sugar products.\n\n\n“Valio’s expertise in product development and technology is unique on the global level, and rests on more than a century of experience and know-how. For example, we are studying the potential for using new kinds of fermentation cultures and enzymes for enhancing flavor. We will also examine how we can even more effectively use the sugar contained in berries and fruit and how modern technologies can be used to create great taste at our new snack plant in Riihimäki, Southern Finland ”, says Kaukovirta-Norja.\n\n"

The six flavour combinations in the gourmet ice cream family will be the only Finnish, lactose free product line alternative in the markets. The products will be produced at Valio's Oulu dairy and will be sold later in spring also in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n\nFinns are known to be ice cream lovers who enjoy the cold treat year-round. The good news is that – for the first time in 14 years – ice cream lovers can look forward to again seeing Valio ice cream on store shelves this coming spring.\n\n\n“Valio’s ice creams continue to hold a soft spot in the hearts of Finns: more than 61% of those surveyed mentioned us as an ice cream brand that spontaneously comes to mind.* We also continuously hear from consumers about their ice cream desires. Now we can finally fulfil them,” says Senior Vice President \nJussi Mattsson\n.\n\n\nThe new Valio Ice Cream will bring a delicious alternative to the super premium category of gourmet ice cream that has grown in recent years. With six different flavour combinations, Valio Ice Cream is the market’s only lactose free line of ice cream that features full-flavoured ice cream combined with generous swirls of sauces and jams and delicious bits of cookies and sweets. The exciting flavour combinations are bursting with beloved Nordic preferences, like blueberry, rye, salty liquorish and coffee. \n\n\n“Valio has long history as an ice cream producer, and we know what the Finns like when it comes to ice cream. We want to offer ice cream lovers something new and delicious and that many people can enjoy. That’s why Valio Ice Cream is always lactose free and features unique flavour combinations,” Jussi Mattsson says. \n\n\nThe taste of Finnish expertise in Valio ice cream\n\n\nThe new line of ice cream will be produced at Valio’s Oulu dairy in northern Finland with milk sourced from Valio’s co-operative dairy farms in the same area. Most of the jams and sauces in the ice creams have been developed and produced at Valio’s own jam factory.\n\n\nOulu’s ice cream producers and Valio’s product development have created six exciting flavour combinations: crazy caramel with a hint of salt, fresh strawberry-basil, very Finnish blueberry-rye, juicy carrot cake, smooth macchiato-chocolate, and kick-it-up salty liquorish-chilli.\n\n\n“The launch will also bring Valio’s ice cream back to the Oulu dairy, where ice cream was last produced in the early 1980s. Making the ice cream has been truly inspiring for us because this ice cream is being produced with a totally new recipe and with new equipment,” says Valio Oulu Plant Director Martti Kimpimäki.\n\n\nReturning to the Russian ice cream market\n\n\nIn addition to Finland, the ice cream will be sold also in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Ice cream is one of the products not included in the Russian Government’s import ban. From 2014, Valio has exported juices, berry soups and Valio Baby® infant formulas from Finland to Russia.

        "text": "\n\nFrom the beginning of this year, Valio will pay one cent extra per litre to entrepreneurs who have proven themselves committed to responsible dairy production. For the consumers, ensuring animal welfare is one of the most important ways in which Valio has an effect on the society.\n\n\nValio has implemented the most extensive renewal of quality and production practices in the company’s history. The aim of this development work is to promote animal wellbeing and a better quality of life for the animals. As of January 2018, Valio will pay a “responsibility bonus” to the entrepreneurs who commit to various measures to promote animal wellbeing, such as planned healthcare for the animals. The responsibility bonus is one cent per litre of milk. At present, about 80% of Valio dairy farms are covered by the reforms, and the goal is to have all farms involved by 2020.\n\n\n– The scale of these reforms is so large that they could well be compared to the Finnish social and healthcare reforms that are currently being planned – for humans. “We’re delighted to see that dairy farmers throughout Finland are so committed to these changes. About 4,600 of the 5,800 dairy farms in the Valio group are already following the new guidelines. We will continue to provide local training, and expect a lot more farms to join the programme this year,” says \nJuha Nousiainen,\n director of farm services at Valio.\n\n\nIn December 2017, Valio carried out a survey in Finland of the company’s approach to responsibility from the perspective of Valio stakeholders. A majority of the respondents believe that animal welfare is one of the most important ways in which Valio has an effect on Finnish society. Two out of three consumers consider Valio’s quality and production reforms to be a major step forward in ensuring greater responsibility. More than 1,000 consumers participated in the survey. The respondents range in age from 18 to 75, and the sample was representative of the overall Finnish population in terms of age, gender and place of residence. The survey was implemented by the communications company Prior Konsultointi Oy.\n\n\n– “Animal welfare is increasingly important to consumers. Responsible production is absolutely essential for ensuring ethical milk production, and for ensuring that dairy products remain attractive to consumers,” says Nousiainen.\n\n\nSystematic and preventive healthcare is essential to animal welfare\n\n\nPromoting a better life for animals means, among other things, that all the cattle on dairy farms are covered by planned healthcare, and that all the animals are included in the centralised healthcare register for Finnish cattle herds (Naseva). This ensures that a veterinarian visits the farm at least once a year to assess many matters related to the wellbeing and health of the cows. The data are comparable between different farms. To receive the responsibility bonus, each dairy farm must also implement regular monitoring of the condition of the hooves. They must also ensure that pain relief and sedatives are given to calves as part of dehorning, and that the procedure is carried out under the supervision of a vet. This has long been standard practice at most farms.\n\n\nAccording to the production guidelines, every new barn must be a free-stall barn, meaning that it is built in such a way that the cows are freely able to spend time outdoors or to graze. At present, a total of about 55 percent of the cows on Valio farms live in such cowsheds. As in previous years, Valio also requires that the animal feed is free of soy and genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\n\n\n– “Finnish cows are already the healthiest in the European Union, which is why, for example, we use antibiotics very little compared to other EU countries. We support and encourage the dairy farmers to focus more than ever on animal welfare,” says \nVesa Kaunisto\n, chairman of the board at Valio. Kaunisto has his own dairy farm of 36 cows in the Ostrobothnian municipality of Veteli, in the west of Finland.\n\n\nThe welfare of animals on Valio farms is good by international standards, and about 96% of the milk received by Valio is in the highest quality category. In Finland, antibiotics are only administered when prescribed by a vet in response to a health problem – they are never prescribed or given preventively. As a result, the use of antibiotics in Finland is markedly less than in Central Europe, for example.\n\n\nAnimal welfare in milk production is important not only as a question of ethics, but also in economic terms. Cattle that are healthy and contented also have a higher milk yield. Increased milk yield is partly explained by the quality of the feed and by progress in breeding. But investing in animal welfare is extremely important in this respect as well.\n\n"

Our product development expertise is world-class: we use our more than 100 years of innovation and technology knowledge to offer high-quality products from various ingredients in addition to our main raw material milk. For example, we have been making juices and berry soups for decades. Now consumers will be able to enjoy these great flavours again but in a new product category,” summarizes Valio’s CEO Annikka Hurme.\n\n\n“Valio is a dairy cooperative owned by Finnish dairy farmers, so milk will continue to be the focus of our operations also in the future.

The ideas can be about reducing methane output per cow, accelerating methan transformation to carbon dioxide, capturing methane or utilising it locally, near the farms. Sign-up is currently underway and will continue until 17 January. The two-day hackathon will be held in February 2018. In addition to cash prizes, the best teams will get the opportunity to refine their concept in cooperation with Valio.\n\n\nHackathons are events in which teams representing different fields gather together, usually for a day or two, to solve a pre-determined task. The judges of the competition include experts from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and Tekes, in addition to representatives of Valio. Valio organises the hackathon together with Ultrahack.\n\n\nIncreasing climate and resource efficiency at the future dairy farm \n\n\nCurbing climate change is a shared challenge. Companies play an important role in finding solutions to this. “The methane production of Finnish dairy farms has declined by nearly 40 percent over the past 25 years, mainly due to animal breeding. As a significant milk producer Valio is responsible for continuously pursuing solutions that would allow us to reduce and use the methane gas generated as efficiently as possible. The new ideas yielded by the competition will benefit the entire agricultural sector,” says Mika Koskinen, Executive Vice President at Valio.\n\n\n“In terms of the participants, we are looking for teams with the ability to come up with creative ideas and with multi-disciplinary know-how for solving the methane challenge. We welcome everyone – from researchers to students and representatives of the business sector. We’re hoping to attract people from diverse backgrounds and with diverse skills in fields ranging from technology to agriculture and service design,” says Virpi Jonson, Valio’s innovation manager in charge of the competition.\n\n\nCompetition details and further information for teams: \nMilk Farm Methane Hack\n\n\nThe competition is suitable for teams with expertise in the following areas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas technology and modelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement and sensor technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIoT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarn building\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiogas processing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiomaterials\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual modelling or process modelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService design\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem analytics\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nValio is taking a major step towards even more environment smart package solutions as the company is significantly increasing the use of fully plant-based gable top cartons. By the end of 2018, all of Valio's milk, buttermilk, yoghurt and cream gable tops for sale in Finland will be made from plant-based materials. The carbon footprint of a plant-based carton is less than 50% compared to a conventional gable top.\n\n\n“In our sustainability programme, we are committed to offering consumers the world’s most sustainable dairy packaging solutions.  Already in 2015, Valio became the first company in the world to introduce milk cartons made from fully plant-based, renewable material for the company’s organic Valio Luomu™ milk products after a pilot with Valio Eila® lactose free semi-skimmed milk drink. Now we are stepping up the phased adoption of fully plant-based gable tops and start switching over to more these environment smart packages”, says Tanja Virtanen-Leppä, Head of Packaging at Valio.\n\n\nThe carbon footprint of a plant-based gable top carton is less than 50% compared to conventional package\n\n\nSwitching over to plant-based gable-top cartons is a significant good deed for the environment, especially from climate point of view. Changing from fossil crude oil-based to plant-based plastics improves environmental performance. The carbon footprint of a plant-based gable top with a plant-based screw cap is less than 50% compared to a conventional gable top with a screw cap.*\n\n\n“The amount of products now switching over to plant-based cartons is significant. We are talking about approximately 250 million gable tops a year. This way, we cut packaging related CO2 emissions by 3,140 tonnes a year. This amount of CO2 emissions is equivalent to driving 412 times around the world with an average car”, Tanja Virtanen-Leppä explains.\n\n\nIn a fully plant-based gable top, all components are made of from plant-based materials. Carton is made of paperboard covered with thin watertight plastic layers. Screw cap closure is made of the same plastic used on paperboard outer layers. Paperboard is made of renewable wood fibre and plant-based plastic is made of bioethanol, by-product from the sugar-cane industry. Plants bind carbon dioxide as they grow. This makes plant-based packaging a good choice from climate impact point of view compared to crude oil-based packaging.\n\n\nPlant-based cartons are recycled like conventional gable tops\n\n\nThe properties of a fully plant-based gable top carton are unchanged. Therefore, cartons are recycled the same way as conventional packages. The gable top carton should be rinsed, dried, flattened and then taken to a dedicated recycling container. If the gable top carton has a closure, it can be left in place for recycling or taken out and recycled separately as plastic. Please note that the renewable gable top is not biodegradable.\n\n\nValio’s plant-based gable top carton received the international Scanstar award\n\n\nValio’s project Fully plant-based gable top roll-out will be rewarded with Nordic Scanstar 2017 packaging award in the Environment category of the competition. Scanstar is a Nordic packaging competition organised by Scandinavian Packaging Association, SPA, since 1969.

Valio invented lactose free milk and was the first in the world to launch it in 2001, made with Valio’s unique patented technology. They were able to produce lactose free milk which tastes just like regular milk, with no compromise on flavour or texture. They proceeded to develop a complete range of lactose free products with superior taste. With more than 100 products available in the Nordic and European markets, Valio has the largest lactose free portfolio in the world. The hallmarks of Valio Eila® lactose free products are great taste, high quality and natural goodness with roots in the pure Finnish nature\n\n\nAward-winning taste***\n\n\nValio’s spreadable butter won Gold in the Spreads Category at the recent International Cheese Awards, beating 15 entrants, with the unsalted butter taking bronze in its category.\n\n\nValio cheddar received a Very High Commendation from the jury, the only cheddar not made in traditional cheddar-producing countries like the UK, Ireland or New Zealand, to receive this.\n\n\nValio Gefilus® Kefir yoghurts \n\n\nGut health is a growing global wellbeing trend. Valio Gefilus® Kefir yoghurts combine LGG® (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG), the world’s most researched lactic acid bacterium, with kefir, a natural ingredient growing in reputation as an overall healthy superfood.\n\n\nThe first Valio Gefilus® product, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) lactic acid bacterium, was launched at the beginning of 1990. The range comprises tasty products with natural flavours and less sugar.\n\n\nValio ValSa® full taste, less salt\n\n\nValio invented ValSa® milk salt currently used in spreadable butter and cheese. ValSa® has nearly 80% less sodium than table salt. Valio ValSa® spreadable butter and cheese products deliver great taste, with up to 50% less salt.\n\n\nThe recommended daily intake of salt is exceeded globally (World Health Organisation). Both food manufacturers and consumers want to reduce its intake and keep great taste, but the food industry has struggled to achieve this.  Valio ValSa® delivers.  ValSa® is a no-brainer switch for consumers who will love Valio’s ValSa® cheese and spreadable butters, which contain up to 50% less salt than competitors.  Reduced-salt products have been seen as a sacrifice in terms of taste and quality.  With Valio ValSa® there is no need to compromise on taste.\n\n\nPaavo Salminen\n, Valio’s VP New Markets, said: “Valio launched 126 new products last year. Special products and concepts that promote wellbeing, plus the cleanest milk in the EU define Valio’s competitive advantages. Lactose free Valio Eila® products, and Valio Gefilus® Kefir products are export leaders. The ValSa® milk salt concept is a huge development and real game changer. We are looking forward to showcasing these products at Anuga and getting valuable feedback from our customers.”\n\n\nValio will be at Anuga from 7 to 11 October 2017 in hall 10.1, stand E009, Koelnmesse, Cologne, Germany.\n\n\n*ref Reg.

Every year, the survey lists the most trustworthy and reputable companies in Finland and investigates the factors that steer their national reputation.\n\n\nStudies have shown reputation to have an effect on attitudes towards a company and its products—whether people want to work there, buy the company’s products and recommend them to others, and whether they trust what the company aims to communicate. The aforementioned are collectively referred to as stakeholder support.\n\n\nThe expectations for Valio are high, and include working for the greater good, integrity and openness, interaction, and excellent products. It is therefore no surprise that the stakeholder support given to Valio is strongly influenced by how responsibly it is perceived to operate.\n\n\nIn the survey, responsibility measures how correctly and responsibly a company is seen to operate in relation to the environment and society.  Other factors influencing a company’s responsibility include its \nadministration, management, products and services, innovativeness, financial performance, interaction and attractiveness as an employer\n.\n\n\nAccording to the 2017 Reputation&Trust survey, Valio’s reputation is good: on a scale of one to five, it improved from 3.59 to 3.65, which is statistically significant.

The new boiler facility in Jyväskylä uses bioenergy. At the moment, most of the heating energy needed by the dairy and the steam required by its production are generated with local fuels. In addition to heat recovered in the process, the heating of the properties relies partly on district heating. The old heavy fuel oil-fired boilers will be converted into peak load and auxiliary boilers running on light fuel oil. Thanks to the new boiler plant, the CO2 emissions of the Jyväskylä dairy will be reduced to nearly a third of the previous level. The boiler investment of the Jyväskylä dairy is part of Valio’s sustainability programme.  \n\n\n“The new boiler plant in Jyväskylä will increase production reliability and the capacity for steam generation. Solid domestic fuels will improve the supply security of the milk processing chain, while the use of biofuels will reduce the dairy’s carbon footprint. The investment will also increase employment in the facility’s operation, maintenance and fuel chain. This year, the Jyväskylä dairy has also made significant improvements in the utilisation of heat recovered from production equipment, thereby reducing the dairy’s primary energy consumption,” says \nJukka Partti\n, plant director of Valio Jyväskylä dairy. Investments in the improvement of energy efficiency and more eco-friendly heat production are good examples of Valio’s responsible investment programme, which will secure responsible and profitable milk production and processing in Finland.\n\n\nValio has made long-term and responsible investments in heating plants utilizing domestic fuels. The previous such an investment was the boiler plant of the Oulu dairy, which was renewed in 2016. In 2016, solid domestic fuels accounted for 72 per cent of Valio’s heat production.

These are the things that people expect from their snacks, and our new snack plant meets these needs,” says Valio CEO Annikka Hurme. “The plant is a concrete example of how seriously we take our responsibilities, since many loss-reducing and natural resource-saving choices were made in its planning and construction. The new plant also combines Valio Riihimäki’s 50-year tradition of yoghurt manufacturing with the most advanced technology,” promises Valio CEO Annikka Hurme.\n\n\n“We at Valio believe in the future of responsible dairy production and profitable milk processing,” says Vesa Kaunisto, Chairman of the Board at Valio. “The continued profitability of dairy farming is best ensured when the company they own, Valio, succeeds in a competitive field and, therefore, remains able to pay a good price to its shareholders through cooperatives. This modern snack plant makes us even more competitive, both in Finland and on the export market.” Kaunisto adds that once the snack plant comes into operation, almost half of its production will be for the export market, for the time being largely Sweden and Denmark. “However, in the future we expect to expand to other countries.”\n\n\nA new standard of eco-friendliness\n\n\nEnvironmental friendliness was ensured in the plant in several ways. Resource efficiency guided the design of the plant, and is at the heart of all its operations. Many choices and solutions were made and implemented to reduce waste and save resources.\n\n\n“The material flows in the plant are efficient, because manufacturing of the products is straightforward. There are no unnecessary intermediate steps,” says project manager Jukka Partti. “For this reason, the raw materials used in production, the packaging materials, and the finished products themselves also flow seamlessly from one stage to another without excessive handling.”\n\n\nThe plant uses about 30% less energy per unit of production than the old factory Valio Riihimäki. To achieve maximum energy efficiency, the plant makes efficient use of the waste heat generated during manufacturing. In the new type of refrigerated warehouse, the products are cooled quickly, while saving energy at the same time. The products are cooled by the free cooling method, so that in colder weather the low outside temperature is used to make the process more energy-efficient. Thanks to the energy-saving technology and heat recovery systems, the new plant uses energy production from the existing heat production plant. In other words, there was no need to expand capacity. More than three-quarters of the thermal energy used at Valio Riihimäki comes from renewable fuel.\n\n\nSignificant resources have also been invested in effective and efficient food loss management has also been invested. The manufacturing and packaging equipment are designed to minimise product loss. The standards of hygiene in the plant are top-class, since the manufacturing equipment is completely isolated from the surrounding environment. The rigorous standards of hygiene reduce losses throughout the manufacturing chain, from the factory to the consumer’s table.\n\n\nRespect and consideration for the environment are also accentuated by the location of the plant in Riihimäki. The plant is centrally located in Finland, thereby allowing both the milk collection plant and the finished products to be distributed and exported efficiently and with minimal impact on the environment.\n\n\nThe latest technology\n\n\nThe plant uses the very latest equipment and technology, allowing Valio to get the best possible benefit from its unique R&D expertise. The design of the new manufacturing processes in the plant has taken account of all the established operating, and has integrated them with the new technology.\n\n\nThis means that in the new snack plant, innovation and tradition go hand in hand. When it was first opened, Valio Riihimäki was the most modern dairy in Europe; and now, 50 years later, it is once again a pioneer. The 50 years of expertise and tradition in manufacturing yoghurts are melded with the latest technology and manufacturing equipment.\n\n\nIn the first phase, the plant will manufacture products that are already familiar to Finnish consumers, such as the Valiojogurtti® series. Once the plant becomes fully operational, consumers around the world will also be able to enjoy a whole new kind of innovative snack products that are both healthy and delicious. New types of recipes for snacks will be used in the new plant. There are new ways to reduce sugar, and, for example, the protein or fat content of products can be varied in innovative ways. The plant meets the strictest quality standards.\n\n\nKey indicators:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe snack plant is the largest single investment in Valio’s history, with a value of EUR170 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction of the new snack plant began in 2014 and took about three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plant site covers an area of about 53 hectares, of which about 265,000 square metres are floor space. The area of the plant building is approximately 20,000 square metres. The plant is a five-storey building.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 4,000 people were involved in building the plant during the three years of its construction. A total of about 1.1 million work hours went into construction of the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plant has an annual production capacity of around 120 million kilos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValio employs a total of about 440 people at Valio Riihimäki plants and in total Valio provides employment for more than 4,000 employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The UN’s revised 2017 forecast sees the population rising to 8.6 billion by 2030 and 9.8 billion by 2050. Sustainable food production must deliver enough nutritional value.\n\n\nIn October 2016, the International Dairy Federation (IDF) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) signed a declaration to promote world sustainable milk production (The Dairy Declaration of Rotterdam). The dairy industry is committed to the sustainable development of milk production.\n\n\nDairy industry bodies and national committees in IDF member countries are supporting the commitment and signing the declaration. The Finnish committee added its name to the signatories on 1st August 2017. The declaration was signed by \nRiitta Brandt\n, Chair of the Finnish National Committee of the IDF and Executive Director of the Finnish Milk Processors and Dairy Products Wholesalers Association, and Dr \nJudith Bryans\n, President of the IDF.\n\n\nThe FAO considers dairy farming an important sector of primary production in securing the nutrition and livelihood of the world population.

        "text": "\n\nValio has been recognized for enhancing the efficiency of its energy consumption from 2008–2016. The Energy Efficiency Agreements 20th anniversary seminar held at Finlandia Hall in Helsinki on 15 June 2017 noted that Valio saved one-and-a-half times more energy than the goals set.\n\n\nThe Finnish Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, Ministry of the Environment, the Energy Authority, and energy and materials specialist Motiva, recognized a total of 18 companies and municipalities for effective and exemplary work on energy efficiency from 2008–2016. The seminar noted Valio’s achievement as follows:\n\n\nValio has acted in an exemplary manner, effectively and in the long run within the food industry program of the Energy Efficiency Agreement for Industries from 2008–2016. The company has reached and exceeded its goal within the agreement\n saving one-and-a-half times more energy than envisaged by the end of 2016. Valio reported on more than 130 energy efficiency measures it has implemented to generate those savings. The biggest energy savings were achieved through investments in thermal pump technology. Valio is participating in the new agreement period and is committed to enhancing its energy consumption in the coming years.\n\n\nThe new Energy Efficiency Agreement for the food industry that launched this year targets 4% in energy savings by 2020 and 7.5% by 2025. The energy saving outcomes of the measures to be taken compared to a scenario where the measures hadn’t been implemented will be considered savings. This does not mean the total of a participating company’s energy consumption will necessarily decrease. The total energy Valio consumes depends for example on the volume of products it manufactures.\n\n\n“Valio considers energy saving and increasing the use of renewable energy important elements of sustainable business operations, both for the sake of the environment and for economic benefit. The credit for exceeding the goals belongs to the personnel of our 12 production plants. Each plant has a member of staff responsible for energy efficiency issues who’s familiar with the production unit and has the ability to identify energy saving solutions. At Group level we focus on conveying valuable ideas, and supporting and encouraging the production plants in advancing their energy saving performance. Throwing money at the problem doesn’t necessarily help, although we have developed improvements in operating technology that save energy,” says \nPeter Fabritius\n, Energy Manager at Valio.\n\n\nValio consumes thermal energy in e.g. powder product drying, heat treatment for specific products, cleaning, and heating buildings. Electricity is mainly required to run process equipment and in product refrigeration.\n\n\n“The greatest savings originate from the thermal pump projects that make up some of our largest investments in energy efficiency factors. The advantage of thermal pumps is that they deliver both heating and cooling. The biggest single energy efficiency project run during the agreement period was implemented at Valio’s Seinäjoki plant where two large thermal pumps were installed in 2012. Other major projects include a variety of heat recovery initiatives. For example, dairy products are heated to a high temperature in pasteurisation, and the recovery and re-use of the waste heat generated in the process is significant,” Mr Fabritius says.\n\n\nFood industry companies participate in the adoption of energy saving measures alongside other industry sectors through voluntary agreements. These are an efficient way to satisfy the EU’s strict requirements on the more efficient use of energy and respond to the need to decelerate climate change.\n\n\nThe energy saving measures implemented by Finnish companies and municipalities from 2008–2016 enhanced energy consumption by nearly 16 terawatt hours by the end of 2016. This is more than the total thermal energy consumption of all residential apartment blocks in Finland. The savings have been generated by hundreds of companies and municipalities implementing in total more than 20 000 different measures, investing well over one billion euros in energy efficiency.\n\n"

        "text": "\n\nA series of lean years for Finnish dairy farmer entrepreneurs and Valio Ltd continued in 2016 but the downward trend has stabilised. Despite the challenges, Valio was able to pay its owners, the dairy farmer entrepreneurs, around 8 cents above the European average per litre of raw milk.\n\n\nValio Group net sales for 2016 decreased by 4.7% on the previous year to stand at 1 638 million euros. The weakness of the dairy sector was primarily due to the imbalance in global markets. The Russian market remains inaccessible, demand in Asia continued to be poor, and the oversupply of milk in the EU is ongoing. The Finnish market is subject to fierce competition from imported products.\n\n\n“The company’s successful cost savings program also promoted Valio’s ability to pay its owner entrepreneurs a higher price for raw milk than the European average. In 2016, Valio Ltd reduced its costs in Finland by 6% compared with 2015 excluding the price paid for raw milk. We aim in line with Valio’s owner strategy to keep the price paid for raw milk to the owners as stable and predictable as possible. In the rest of the EU, the fluctuation of the raw milk price has exceeded 12 cents/kg and the lowest recorded average price was close to 25 cents/kg. Valio’s price paid in 2016 was 38.1 cents per litre,” says dairy farmer Vesa Kaunisto, Chairman of the Board at Valio.\n\n\nIn 2017, Valio is seeking growth for example by entering new markets for consumer products.\n\n\nValio’s competitive advantages include sustainable milk production and products promoting well-being\n\n\nValio’s competitive advantages both in Finland and abroad are special products and concepts that promote well-being, and the cleanest milk in the EU.\n\n\n“Lactose free Valio Eila® products and Valio Gefilus® products containing the world’s most researched lactic acid bacteria all benefit stomach well-being and are our leading export brands. ValSa® milk salt is a unique innovation that promotes public health. This milk mineral mix with the low sodium content is combined with production expertise at Valio to create tasty cheese and spreads. The first ValSa® products in Finland are Valio Oivariini® less salt and Valio Polar® slices and blocks, and there are more lower salt products to come in our domestic market in 2017. The new snacks plant in Riihimäki will start production this year, lending R&D further encouragement to develop tasty snack products with less sugar. Demand for organic products is expected to increase and for protein-rich products will probably remain strong. Valio launched 126 new products in 2016, including Valio MiFU® cooking crumbs, a completely new kind of product that became market leader as a new type of protein source for meals,” Valio CEO Annikka Hurme says of the outlook.\n\n\n“There are some indications of the beginning of an economic recovery in Finland and Europe, which will surely increase interest in high-quality value added products. By global comparison, Valio manufactures luxury class dairy products from GMO-free raw milk whose production is virtually soy free and adds no unnecessary antibiotics. Consumers are interested in food, nutrition and sustainability, and actively challenge the food industry and brands to take their wishes on-board. An active discussion on food creates a good foundation for developing our business.”\n\n\nKey figures 2016\n\n\nValio Group net sales for 2016 decreased by 4.7% on the previous year to stand at 1 638 million euros (2015: MEUR 1 718). Net sales fell by 4% in international markets and 5% in Finland. Exports and international operations accounted for around 35% of net sales. Valio exports from Finland totalled 353 million euros by value, accounting for nearly 26% of Finland’s food exports (Source: Elintarviketalous 2017).\n\n\nNet sales for the subsidiaries developed in Sweden by +4% (MEUR 98), Baltic States +9% (MEUR 93), US -2% (MEUR 72), Russia +5% (MEUR 66), China -27% (MEUR 30), and Denmark +11% (MEUR 4). The fall in the value of sales in China was due to decreased demand for industrial powders and their low global market price. In the US, net sales were affected by fierce price competition and the currency exchange rate.\n\n\nThe Valio Group milk margin** stood at 772 million euros (2015: MEUR 806). The milk return* fell to 36.1 cents/litre (2015: 36.5 cents/litre), while the price paid for raw milk stood at 38.1 cents/litre (2015: 38.5 cents/litre).\n\n\nValio Group’s equity/assets ratio was 43% (2015: 42%). Investments totalled 127 million euros (2015: MEUR 119).\n\n\nThe milk volume taken in by Valio from its owners totalled 1 861 million litres (2015: 1 899 million litres).\n\n\nIn 2016, Valio paid its owner entrepreneurs 716 million euros, down 23 million euros on the previous year.\n\n\n* Milk return = (Milk margin less the requirement for depreciation of fixed assets i.e. financing requirement for investments)/milk volume supplied by the owners.** Milk margin = Net sales less other costs excluding depreciation and the price paid for raw milk and interest on shareholder loan paid to owners.\n\n"
